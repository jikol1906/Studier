than that. Cloud service is important to organizations that house data about
their customers and their inventory, and it can be overwhelming ­ not to mention, expensive.

Maintaining on-premises IT infrastructure can be both costly and labor intensive. That's why customer demand for cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is accelerating as organizations continue to pursue digital strategies. However, top talent
with cloud computing skills and experience is still hard to find.

Learning how to analyze, evaluate and design cloud service solutions requires a fundamental understanding of the different components that are commonly used.

Common types of cloud computing services (/content/articles/cloud-types-solutions-and-vendors) include the following:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Defined

TheGoeffticSiatlaIrataeSddeWfinitithioCnliosuads follows: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provides compute, memory, storCaogem, npeuttwinorgking and related software, such as operating systems and databases, as a cloud service to
replace traditional on-premises data center infrastructure.

EaPrrnivaatceloCuldoucdo:mInpfuratisntgructure services are provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. ceTrhtiefipcahtyisoincal infrastructure may be owned, managed and operated by the organization, a third (hptatprtsy:/o/wr swowm.ceocmomptbiain.oartgio/cne, ratnifdicaittimonays/ecxloisutdo)n or off premises.
Public Cloud: Infrastructure services are provisioned for use by multiple organizations (also known as a multi-tenant model). The physical infrastructure may be owned, managed and operated by a business, academic or government organization, or some combination. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider. Hybrid Cloud: A company chooses to leverage both public cloud and private cloud for applications or overall architecture. The two cloud models remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability.

A Brief History of Cloud Computing
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the pioneer of cloud computing as we know it. According to Jeff Bezos, the mission of AWS was to provide the "application developers a set of dependable tools and a reliable infrastructure that they could build products on top of." Microsoft (Azure) Google (Google Cloud), IBM (IBM Smart Cloud) and Oracle (Oracle Cloud) quickly followed suit. Today the range of cloud computing services is quite broad.

Advantages of IaaS

IaaS is advantageous to companies in scenarios where scalability and quick provisioning are key. In other

words, organizations experiencing rapid growth but lacking the capital to invest in hardware are great

candidates for IaaS models. IaaS can also be beneficial to companies with steady application workloads

weigh in on before deployment.

Challenges may include the following:

Unexpected Costs: Monthly fees can add up, or peak usage may be more than expected Process Changes: IaaS may require changes to processes and workflows Runaway Inventory: Instances may be deployed, but not taken down Security Risks: While IaaS providers secure the infrastructure, businesses are responsible for anything they host Lack of Support: Live help is sometimes hard to come by Complex Integration: Challenges with interaction with existing systems Security Risks: New vulnerabilities may emerge around the loss of direct control Limited Customization: Public cloud users may have limited control and ability to customize Vendor Lock-In: Moving from one IaaS provider to another can be challenging Broadband Dependency: Only as good as the reliability of the internet connection Providers Not Created Equally: Vendor vetting (https://www.comptia.org/blog/all-ahead-cloudspeed-how-to-choose-a-cloud-vendor) and selection can be challenging Managing Availability: Even the largest service providers experience downtime Confusing SLAs: Service level agreements (SLAs) can be difficult to understand Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving federal and state laws can impact some industries' use of IaaS, especially across country borders Vendor Consolidation: Providers may be acquired or go out of business

Examples of IaaS

ClouGdebtuSstinaerstsedis bWooitmhinCglo. Iundfact, Gartner (https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=12G2COo5mFCp&uctti=n1g50519) projects revenue in the cloud IaaS market to increase to $81.5 billion by 2022, up
from $41.4 billion in 2019. Businesses are using IaaS in a variety of ways:

certification Ano(hthtteprse:/x/awmwpwle.coofmlepvteiara.ogringg/ccelrotuifdicaintiforansst/rculcotuudr)e is storing security video files. Since video files consume a large amount of data, a management application is needed to store these files with easy access. IaaS cloud storage is an ideal solution for managing these files.

Companies in every stage of the business lifecycle are using IaaS solutions. From global enterprises to startups, the flexibility, scalability and cost savings are hard to beat.

Popular IaaS providers include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Google Compute Engine.

Microsoft Azure (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. Amazon Web Services (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. Rackspace (https://www.rackspace.com/) is a managed cloud computing company that aims to make it easy to manage private and public cloud deployments. The company is the largest managed cloud provider, offering expertise across cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and OpenStack. Google Compute Engine (https://cloud.google.com/compute) is Google's IaaS virtual machine offering. It allows customers to use powerful virtual machines in the cloud as server resources instead of acquiring and managing server hardware.

It's not surprising that newer cloud models are entering the space that work alongside IaaS. Containers and serverless architecture are two such service models giving companies new options for how to run their applications. At this point, simple
IaaS solutions continue to be the most mature option, but trend spotters are keeping their eye on containers and serverless architecture as new and emerging technology.
