Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Components
What is AWS Fargate?
AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances. With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing.
When you run your Amazon ECS tasks and services with the Fargate launch type or a Fargate capacity provider, you package your application in containers, specify the Operating System, CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. Each Fargate task has its own isolation boundary and does not share the underlying kernel, CPU resources, memory resources, or elastic network interface with another task.
For information about Fargate architecture, see Using the Fargate launch type in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
This topic describes the different components of Fargate tasks and services, and calls out special considerations for using Fargate with Amazon ECS.
Components
Clusters
An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services. You can use clusters to isolate your applications. When your tasks are run on Fargate, your cluster resources are also managed by Fargate.
Task definitions
A task definition is a text file that describes one or more containers that form your application. It's in JSON format. You can use it to describe up to a maximum of ten containers. The task definition functions as a blueprint for your application. It specifies the various parameters for your application. For example, you can use it to specify parameters for the operating system, which containers to use, which ports to open for your application, and what data volumes to use with the containers in the task. The specific parameters available for your task definition depend on the needs of your specific application.
Your entire application stack doesn't need to be on a single task definition. In fact, we recommend spanning your application across multiple task definitions. You can do this by combining related containers into their own task definitions, each representing a single component.
Tasks
A task is the instantiation of a task definition within a cluster. After you create a task definition for your application within Amazon ECS, you can specify the number of tasks to run on your cluster. You can run a standalone task, or you can run a task as part of a service.
Services
You can use an Amazon ECS service to run and maintain your desired number of tasks simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster. How it works is that, if any of your tasks fail or stop for any reason, the Amazon
1

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Operating System and CPU architecture
ECS service scheduler launches another instance based on your task definition. It does this to replace it and thereby maintain your desired number of tasks in the service.
Operating System and CPU architecture
The following operating systems are supported: · Amazon Linux 2 · Windows Server 2019 Full · Windows Server 2019 Core
If you use Windows containers on Fargate, review the section called "Windows containers on AWS Fargate considerations" (p. 2). There are 2 architectures available for the Amazon ECS task definition, ARM and X86_64. When you run Windows containers on Fargate, you must have an X86_64 CPU architecture. When you run Linux containers on Fargate, you can use the X86_64 CPU architecture, or the ARM64 architecture for your ARM-based applications. For more information, see the section called "Working with 64-bit ARM workloads on Amazon ECS" (p. 125).
Regions
For information about the Regions that support Linux containers on Fargate, see the section called "Supported Regions for Linux containers on AWS Fargate" (p. 285). For information about the Regions that support Windows containers on Fargate, see the section called "Supported Regions for Windows containers on AWS Fargate" (p. 286).
Windows containers on AWS Fargate considerations
Windows containers on AWS Fargate supports the following operating systems: · Windows Server 2019 Full · Windows Server 2019 Core
AWS handles the operating system license management, so you do not need any additional Microsoft licenses. Windows containers on AWS Fargate supports the awslogs driver. For more information, see the section called "Using the awslogs log driver" (p. 138). Your tasks can run either Linux containers or Windows containers. If you need run both container types, you must create separate tasks. The following features are not supported on Windows containers on Fargate: · Group managed service accounts (gMSA)

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Getting started walkthroughs
· Amazon FSx · ENI trunking · App Mesh service and proxy integration for tasks · Firelens log router integration for tasks · Configurable ephemeral storage · EFS volumes · The Fargate Spot capacity provider · Image volumes
The Dockerfile volume option is ignored. Instead, use bind mounts in your task definition. For more information, see Bind mounts (p. 132).

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Set up
Getting started with Amazon ECS
The following guides provide an introduction to the tools available to access Amazon ECS and introductory step by step procedures to run containers. Docker basics takes you through the basic steps to create a Docker container image and upload it to an Amazon ECR private repository. The getting started guides walk you through using the AWS Copilot command line interface and the AWS Management Console to complete the common tasks to run your containers on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate. Contents
· Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) · Creating a container image for use on Amazon ECS (p. 7) · Getting started with Amazon ECS using AWS Copilot (p. 11) · Getting started with Amazon ECS using the AWS CDK (p. 16) · Getting started with Amazon ECS using the classic console (p. 23)
Set up to use Amazon ECS
If you've already signed up for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and have been using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), you are close to being able to use Amazon ECS. The set-up process for the two services is similar. The following guide prepares you for launching your first Amazon ECS cluster. Complete the following tasks to get set up for Amazon ECS.
Sign up for AWS
When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services, including Amazon EC2 and Amazon ECS. You are charged only for the services that you use. If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.
To create an AWS account 1. Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup. 2. Follow the online instructions.
Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
Note your AWS account number, because you'll need it for the next task.
Create an IAM user
Services in AWS, such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon ECS, require that you provide credentials when you access them, so that the service can determine whether you have permission to access its resources. The
4

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Create an IAM user
console requires your password. You can create access keys for your AWS account to access the command line interface or API. However, we don't recommend that you access AWS using the credentials for your AWS account; we recommend that you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instead. Create an IAM user, and then add the user to an IAM group with administrative permissions or and grant this user administrative permissions. You can then access AWS using a special URL and the credentials for the IAM user.
If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console.
To create an administrator user for yourself and add the user to an administrators group (console)
1. Sign in to the IAM console as the account owner by choosing Root user and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.
Note We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the Administrator IAM user that follows and securely lock away the root user credentials. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few account and service management tasks. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Users and then choose Add users. 3. For User name, enter Administrator. 4. Select the check box next to AWS Management Console access. Then select Custom password, and then enter your new password in the text box. 5. (Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to User must create a new password at next sign-in to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in. 6. Choose Next: Permissions. 7. Under Set permissions, choose Add user to group. 8. Choose Create group. 9. In the Create group dialog box, for Group name enter Administrators. 10. Choose Filter policies, and then select AWS managed - job function to filter the table contents. 11. In the policy list, select the check box for AdministratorAccess. Then choose Create group.
Note You must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the AdministratorAccess permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. To do this, follow the instructions in step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console. 12. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group. Choose Refresh if necessary to see the group in the list. 13. Choose Next: Tags. 14. (Optional) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more information about using tags in IAM, see Tagging IAM entities in the IAM User Guide. 15. Choose Next: Review to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, choose Create user.
You can use this same process to create more groups and users and to give your users access to your AWS account resources. To learn about using policies that restrict user permissions to specific AWS resources, see Access management and Example policies.
To sign in as this new IAM user, sign out of the AWS console, then use the following URL, where your_aws_account_id is your AWS account number without the hyphens (for example, if your AWS account number is 1234-5678-9012, your AWS account ID is 123456789012):
5

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Create a virtual private cloud

https://your_aws_account_id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
Enter the IAM user name and password that you just created. When you're signed in, the navigation bar displays "your_user_name @ your_aws_account_id".
If you don't want the URL for your sign-in page to contain your AWS account ID, you can create an account alias. From the top of the IAM dashboard, to the right of your sign-in link, choose Customize and enter an alias, such as your company name. To sign in after you create an account alias, use the following URL:
https://your_account_alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
To verify the sign-in link for IAM users for your account, open the IAM console and check under IAM users sign-in link on the dashboard.
For more information about IAM, see the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
Create a virtual private cloud
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined.
Note The Amazon ECS console first-run experience creates a VPC for your cluster, so if you intend to use the Amazon ECS console, you can skip to the next section.
If you have a default VPC, you also can skip this section and move to the next task, Install the AWS CLI (p. 7). To determine whether you have a default VPC, see Supported Platforms in the Amazon EC2 Console in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. Otherwise, you can create a nondefault VPC in your account using the steps below.
Important If your account supports Amazon EC2 Classic in a region, then you do not have a default VPC in that region.
For information about how to create a VPC, see Create a VPC only in the Amazon VPC User Guide and use the following table to determine what options to select.

Option Resources to create Name IPv4 CIDR block
IPv6 CIDR block Tenancy

Value VPC only Optionally provide a name for your VPC. IPv4 CIDR manual input
The CIDR block size must have a size between /16 and /28. No IPv6 CIDR block Default

For more information about Amazon VPC, see What is Amazon VPC? in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Install the AWS CLI
Install the AWS CLI
The AWS Management Console can be used to manage all operations manually with Amazon ECS. However, installing the AWS CLI on your local desktop or a developer box enables you to build scripts that can automate common management tasks in Amazon ECS.
To use the AWS CLI with Amazon ECS, install the latest AWS CLI version. For information about installing the AWS CLI or upgrading it to the latest version, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
Creating a container image for use on Amazon ECS
Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers. Docker is a technology that provides the tools for you to build, run, test, and deploy distributed applications in containers. Docker provides a walkthrough on deploying containers on Amazon ECS. For more information, see Deploying Docker containers on Amazon ECS.
The purpose of the steps outlined here is to walk you through creating your first Docker image and pushing that image to Amazon ECR, which is a container registry, for use in your Amazon ECS task definitions. This walkthrough assumes that you possess a basic understanding of what Docker is and how it works. For more information about Docker, see What is Docker? and the Docker overview.
Important AWS and Docker have collaborated to make a simplified developer experience that enables you to deploy and manage containers on Amazon ECS directly using Docker tools. You can now build and test your containers locally using Docker Desktop and Docker Compose, and then deploy them to Amazon ECS on Fargate. To get started with the Amazon ECS and Docker integration, download Docker Desktop and optionally sign up for a Docker ID. For more information, see Docker Desktop and Docker ID signup.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following prerequisites are met.
· Ensure you have completed the Amazon ECR setup steps. For more information, see Setting up for Amazon ECR in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.
· Your user has the required IAM permissions to access and use the Amazon ECR service. For more information, see Amazon ECR managed policies.
· You have Docker installed. For Docker installation steps for Amazon Linux 2, see Installing Docker on Amazon Linux 2 (p. 7). For all other operating systems, see the Docker documentation at Docker Desktop overview.
· You have the AWS CLI installed and configured. For more information, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
If you don't have or need a local development environment and you prefer to use an Amazon EC2 instance to use Docker, we provide the following steps to launch an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2 and install Docker Engine and the Docker CLI.
Installing Docker on Amazon Linux 2
Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine,
7

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Create a Docker image
the Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, and other tools that are helpful when using Docker with Amazon ECS. For more information about how to install Docker Desktop on your preferred operating system, see Docker Desktop overview.
To install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance 1. Launch an instance with the Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see Launching an instance
in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. 2. Connect to your instance. For more information, see Connect to your Linux instance in the Amazon
EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. 3. Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.
sudo yum update -y
4. Install the most recent Docker Engine package.
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
Important This step assumes you are using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI for your instance. For all other operating systems, see Docker Desktop overview. 5. Start the Docker service.
sudo service docker start
(Optional) To ensure that the Docker daemon starts after each system reboot, run the following command:
sudo systemctl enable docker
6. Add the ec2-user to the docker group so you can execute Docker commands without using sudo.
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
7. Log out and log back in again to pick up the new docker group permissions. You can accomplish this by closing your current SSH terminal window and reconnecting to your instance in a new one. Your new SSH session will have the appropriate docker group permissions.
8. Verify that you can run Docker commands without sudo.
docker info
Note In some cases, you may need to reboot your instance to provide permissions for the ec2user to access the Docker daemon. Try rebooting your instance if you see the following error:
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?
Create a Docker image
Amazon ECS task definitions use Docker images to launch containers on the container instances in your clusters. In this section, you create a Docker image of a simple web application, and test it on your local
8

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Create a Docker image

system or Amazon EC2 instance, and then push the image to the Amazon ECR container registry so you can use it in an Amazon ECS task definition.
To create a Docker image of a simple web application
1. Create a file called Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a manifest that describes the base image to use for your Docker image and what you want installed and running on it. For more information about Dockerfiles, go to the Dockerfile Reference.

touch Dockerfile
2. Edit the Dockerfile you just created and add the following content.

FROM ubuntu:18.04
# Install dependencies RUN apt-get update && \
apt-get -y install apache2
# Install apache and write hello world message RUN echo 'Hello World!' > /var/www/html/index.html
# Configure apache RUN echo '. /etc/apache2/envvars' > /root/run_apache.sh && \
echo 'mkdir -p /var/run/apache2' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \ echo 'mkdir -p /var/lock/apache2' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \ echo '/usr/sbin/apache2 -D FOREGROUND' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \ chmod 755 /root/run_apache.sh
EXPOSE 80
CMD /root/run_apache.sh

This Dockerfile uses the Ubuntu 18.04 image. The RUN instructions update the package caches, install some software packages for the web server, and then write the "Hello World!" content to the web server's document root. The EXPOSE instruction exposes port 80 on the container, and the CMD instruction starts the web server.
3. Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile.
Note Some versions of Docker may require the full path to your Dockerfile in the following command, instead of the relative path shown below.

docker build -t hello-world .
4. Run docker images to verify that the image was created correctly.

docker images --filter reference=hello-world

Output:

REPOSITORY hello-world

TAG latest

IMAGE ID e9ffedc8c286

CREATED 4 minutes ago

SIZE 241MB

5. Run the newly built image. The -p 80:80 option maps the exposed port 80 on the container to port 80 on the host system. For more information about docker run, go to the Docker run reference.

docker run -t -i -p 80:80 hello-world

9

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Push your image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Note Output from the Apache web server is displayed in the terminal window. You can ignore the "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name" message. 6. Open a browser and point to the server that is running Docker and hosting your container.
· If you are using an EC2 instance, this is the Public DNS value for the server, which is the same address you use to connect to the instance with SSH. Make sure that the security group for your instance allows inbound traffic on port 80.
· If you are running Docker locally, point your browser to http://localhost/. · If you are using docker-machine on a Windows or Mac computer, find the IP address of the
VirtualBox VM that is hosting Docker with the docker-machine ip command, substituting machine-name with the name of the docker machine you are using.
docker-machine ip machine-name
You should see a web page with your "Hello World!" statement. 7. Stop the Docker container by typing Ctrl + c.
Push your image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Amazon ECR is a managed AWS Docker registry service. You can use the Docker CLI to push, pull, and manage images in your Amazon ECR repositories. For Amazon ECR product details, featured customer case studies, and FAQs, see the Amazon Elastic Container Registry product detail pages.
To tag your image and push it to Amazon ECR
1. Create an Amazon ECR repository to store your hello-world image. Note the repositoryUri in the output.
Substitute region, with your AWS Region, for example, us-east-1.
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name hello-repository --region region
Output:
{ "repository": { "registryId": "aws_account_id", "repositoryName": "hello-repository", "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:region:aws_account_id:repository/hello-
repository", "createdAt": 1505337806.0, "repositoryUri": "aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository"
} }
2. Tag the hello-world image with the repositoryUri value from the previous step.
docker tag hello-world aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository
10

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Clean up
3. Run the aws ecr get-login-password command. Specify the registry URI you want to authenticate to. For more information, see Registry Authentication in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --passwordstdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
Output:
Login Succeeded
Important If you receive an error, install or upgrade to the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more information, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. 4. Push the image to Amazon ECR with the repositoryUri value from the earlier step.
docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository
Clean up
To continue on with creating an Amazon ECS task definition and launching a task with your container image, skip to the Next steps (p. 11). When you are done experimenting with your Amazon ECR image, you can delete the repository so you are not charged for image storage.
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name hello-repository --region region --force
Next steps
After you have created and pushed your container image to Amazon ECR, you should consider the following next steps. · Getting started with Amazon ECS using the classic console (p. 23) · Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate Linux task using the AWS CLI (p. 397)

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the AWS CDK
copilot app delete
Getting started with Amazon ECS using the AWS CDK
This topic shows you how to deploy a containerized Web server with Amazon Elastic Container Service and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) on Fargate. The AWS CDK is an Infrastructure as Code (IAC) framework that lets you define AWS infrastructure using a full-fledged programming language. You write an app in one of the CDK's supported languages, containing one or more stacks, then synthesize it to an AWS CloudFormation template and deploy the resources to your AWS account.
The AWS Construct Library, included with the CDK, provides APIs that model the resources provided by every AWS service. For the most popular services, the library provides curated constructs that provide smart defaults and implement best practices with fewer required parameters. One of these modules, aws-ecs-patterns, provides high-level abstractions that let you define your containerized service and all necessary supporting resources in only a few lines of code.
The construct we'll be using in this topic is ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService. As you can likely tell from the name, this construct deploys an Amazon ECS service on Fargate behind an application load balancer. The aws-ecs-patterns module also includes constructs that use a network load balancer and/or run on Amazon EC2, if you'd prefer those options.
Before embarking on this task, set up your AWS CDK development environment as described in Getting Started With the AWS CDK - Prerequisites, then install the AWS CDK by issuing:
npm install -g aws-cdk
Note These instructions assume you are using AWS CDK v2.
Topics · Step 1: Set up your AWS CDK project (p. 16) · Step 2: Use the AWS CDK to define a containerized Web server on Fargate (p. 18) · Step 3: Test the Web server (p. 21) · Step 4: Clean up (p. 22) · Next steps (p. 22)
Step 1: Set up your AWS CDK project
Create a directory for your new AWS CDK app and initialize the project.
TypeScript
mkdir hello-ecs cd hello-ecs cdk init --language typescript
JavaScript
mkdir hello-ecs
16

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 1: Set up your AWS CDK project
cd hello-ecs cdk init --language javascript
Python
mkdir hello-ecs cd hello-ecs cdk init --language python
After the project has been initialized, activate the project's virtual environment and install the AWS CDK's baseline dependencies.
source .venv/bin/activate python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Java
mkdir hello-ecs cd hello-ecs cdk init --language java
Import this Maven project to your Java IDE (for example, in Eclipse, use File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects). C#
mkdir hello-ecs cd hello-ecs cdk init --language csharp
Note Be sure to name the directory hello-ecs as shown. The AWS CDK application template uses the name of the project directory to generate names for source files and classes. If you use a different name, your app will not match these instructions.
AWS CDK v2 includes stable constructs for all AWS services in a single package, dubbed aws-cdk-lib. This package is installed as a dependency when you initialize the project (or, in some languages, the first time you build it). In this topic, we use an Amazon ECS Patterns construct, which provides high-level abstractions for working with Amazon ECS. In turn, this module relies on Amazon ECS constructs and others to provision the reseources needed by your Amazon ECS application.
The names you use to import these libraries into your CDK application differs slightly depending on which programming language you use. For reference, here are the names used in each supported CDK programming language.
TypeScript
@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs @aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs-patterns

Step 2: Use the AWS CDK to define a containerized Web server on Fargate
We'll use the container image amazon-ecs-sample from DockerHub. This image contains a PHP Web app running under Amazon Linux 2.
In the AWS CDK project you created, edit the file containing the definition of the stack to look like the code below. You'll recognize the instantiation of the ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService construct--or at least its name.
Note What's a stack? The stack is the unit of deployment: all resources must be in a stack, and all the resources in a stack are deployed together. If a resource fails to deploy, any other resources already deployed are rolled back. An AWS CDK app can contain multiple stacks, and resources in one stack can refer to resources in in another.
TypeScript

You can see in this short snippet:
· The service's logical name, MyWebServer. · The container image, obtained from DockerHub, amazon/amazon-ecs-sample.. · The fact that the load balancer will have a public address and will thus be accessible from the Internet.
If you omit, as we have done here, the Amazon ECS cluster, the underlying Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and Amazon EC2 instances, an Auto Scaling Group, the Application Load Balancer, the necessary IAM roles and policies, and other AWS resources required to deploy the Web server, the AWS CDK will also create these resources. Some automatically-provisioned resources will be shared by all Amazon ECS services defined in the stack.
Save the source file, then issue cdk synth in the app's main directory. The AWS CDK runs the app and synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template from it, then displays the template. The template is about 600 lines of YAML, so only the beginning is shown here. (Your template may have differences from ours.)

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Getting started using the classic console
Getting started with Amazon ECS using the classic console
The following guides provide an introduction to the classic AWS Management Console to complete the common tasks to run your containers on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate.
Contents · Getting started with the classic console using Linux containers on AWS Fargate (p. 23) · Getting started with the classic Amazon ECS console using Windows containers on AWS Fargate (p. 26)
Getting started with the classic console using Linux containers on AWS Fargate
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage your containers. You can host your containers on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For a broad overview on Amazon ECS on Fargate, see What is AWS Fargate? (p. 1).
Get started with Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate by using the Fargate launch type for your tasks. In the Regions where Amazon ECS supports AWS Fargate, the classic Amazon ECS first-run wizard guides you through the process of getting started with Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type. The wizard gives you the option of creating a cluster and launching a sample web application. If you already have a Docker image to launch in Amazon ECS, you can create a task definition with that image and use that for your cluster instead.
Complete the following steps to get started with Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) and that your AWS user has either the permissions specified in the AdministratorAccess or Amazon ECS first-run wizard permissions (p. 333) IAM policy example.
The first-run wizard attempts to automatically create the task execution IAM role, which is required for Fargate tasks. To ensure that the first-run experience is able to create this IAM role, one of the following must be true:
· Your user has administrator access. For more information, see Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4). · Your user has the IAM permissions to create a service role. For more information, see Creating a Role to
Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service. · A user with administrator access has manually created the task execution role so that it is available on
the account to be used. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Step 1: Create a task definition
A task definition is like a blueprint for your application. Each time you launch a task in Amazon ECS, you specify a task definition. The service then knows which Docker image to use for containers, how many containers to use in the task, and the resource allocation for each container.
1. Open the classic console first-run wizard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/firstRun.
23

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the classic console with
Linux containers on AWS Fargate
2. From the navigation bar, select the US East (N. Virginia) Region.
Note You can complete this first-run wizard using these steps for any Region that supports Amazon ECS using Fargate. For more information, see Fargate launch type (p. 124). 3. Configure your container definition parameters.
For Container definition, the first-run wizard comes preloaded with the sample-app, nginx, and tomcat-webserver container definitions in the console. You can optionally rename the container or review and edit the resources used by the container (such as CPU units and memory limits) by choosing Edit and editing the values shown. For more information, see Container definitions (p. 100).
Note If you are using an Amazon ECR image in your container definition, be sure to use the full registry/repository:tag naming for your Amazon ECR images. For example, aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-web-app:latest. 4. For Task definition, the first-run wizard defines a task definition to use with the preloaded container definitions. You can optionally rename the task definition and edit the resources used by the task (such as the Task memory and Task CPU values) by choosing Edit and editing the values shown. For more information, see Task definition parameters (p. 97).
Task definitions created in the first-run wizard are limited to a single container for simplicity. You can create multi-container task definitions later in the Amazon ECS console. 5. Choose Next.
Step 2: Configure the service
In this section of the wizard, select how to configure the Amazon ECS service that is created from your task definition. A service launches and maintains a specified number of copies of the task definition in your cluster. The Amazon ECS sample application is a web-based Hello World­style application that is meant to run indefinitely. By running it as a service, it restarts if the task becomes unhealthy or unexpectedly stops.
The first-run wizard comes preloaded with a service definition, and you can see the sample-appservice service defined in the console. You can optionally rename the service or review and edit the details by choosing Edit and doing the following:
1. In the Service name field, select a name for your service. 2. In the Number of desired tasks field, enter the number of tasks to launch with your specified task
definition. 3. In the Security group field, specify a range of IPv4 addresses to allow inbound traffic from, in CIDR
block notation. For example, 203.0.113.0/24. 4. (Optional) You can choose to use an Application Load Balancer with your service. When a task is
launched from a service that is configured to use a load balancer, the task is registered with the load balancer. Traffic from the load balancer is distributed across the instances in the load balancer. For more information, see Introduction to Application Load Balancers.
Important Application Load Balancers do incur cost while they exist in your AWS resources. For more information, see Application Load Balancer Pricing.
Complete the following steps to use a load balancer with your service.
· In the Container to load balance section, choose the Load balancer listener port. The default value here is set up for the sample application, but you can configure different listener options for the load balancer. For more information, see Service load balancing (p. 252).
24

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the classic console with
Linux containers on AWS Fargate 5. Review your service settings and click Save, Next.
Step 3: Configure the cluster
In this section of the wizard, you name your cluster, and then Amazon ECS takes care of the networking and IAM configuration for you. 1. In the Cluster name field, choose a name for your cluster. 2. Click Next to proceed.
Step 4: Review
1. Review your task definition, task configuration, and cluster configuration and click Create to finish. You are directed to a Launch Status page that shows the status of your launch. It describes each step of the process (this can take a few minutes to complete while your Auto Scaling group is created and populated).
2. After the launch is complete, choose View service.
Step 5: View your service
If your service is a web-based application, such as the Amazon ECS sample application, you can view its containers with a web browser. 1. On the Service: service-name page, choose the Tasks tab. 2. Choose a task from the list of tasks in your service. 3. In the Network section, choose the ENI Id for your task. This takes you to the Amazon EC2 console
where you can view the details of the network interface associated with your task, including the IPv4 Public IP address. 4. Enter the IPv4 Public IP address in your web browser and you should see a webpage that displays the Amazon ECS sample application.
Step 6: Clean up
When you are finished using an Amazon ECS cluster, you should clean up the resources associated with it to avoid incurring charges for resources that you are not using. Some Amazon ECS resources, such as tasks, services, clusters, and container instances, are cleaned up using the Amazon ECS console. Other resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing
25

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the classic console with
Windows containers on AWS Fargate
load balancers, and Auto Scaling groups, must be cleaned up manually in the Amazon EC2 console or by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack that created them.
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, select the cluster to delete. 4. Choose Delete Cluster. At the confirmation prompt, enter delete me and then choose Delete.
Deleting the cluster cleans up the associated resources that were created with the cluster, including Auto Scaling groups, VPCs, or load balancers.
Getting started with the classic Amazon ECS console using Windows containers on AWS Fargate
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage your containers. You can host your containers on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For a broad overview on Amazon ECS on Fargate, see What is AWS Fargate? (p. 1).
Get started with Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate by using the Fargate launch type for your tasks. In the Regions where Amazon ECS supports AWS Fargate, the Amazon ECS first-run wizard guides you through the process of getting started with Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type. The wizard gives you the option of creating a cluster and launching a sample web application. If you already have a Docker image to launch in Amazon ECS, you can create a task definition with that image and use that for your cluster instead.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) and that your AWS user has either the permissions specified in the AdministratorAccess or Amazon ECS first-run wizard permissions (p. 333) IAM policy example.
The first-run wizard attempts to automatically create the task execution IAM role, which is required for Fargate tasks. To ensure that the first-run experience is able to create this IAM role, one of the following must be true:
· Your user has administrator access. For more information, see Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4). · Your user has the IAM permissions to create a service role. For more information, see Creating a Role to
Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service. · A user with administrator access has manually created the task execution role so that it is available on
the account to be used. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Step 1: Create a cluster
You can create a new cluster called windows.
To create a cluster with the AWS Management Console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, choose Create Cluster. 4. Choose Networking only and choose Next step.
26

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the classic console with
Windows containers on AWS Fargate
5. For Cluster name enter a name for your cluster (in this example, windows is the name of the cluster). Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
6. In the Networking section, configure the VPC to launch your container instances into. By default, the cluster creation wizard creates a new VPC with two subnets in different Availability Zones, and a security group open to the internet on port 80. This is a basic setup that works well for an HTTP service. However, you can modify these settings by following the substeps below.
a. To create a new VPC, select CreateVPC. b. (Optional) If you chose to create a new VPC, for CIDR Block, enter a CIDR block for your VPC.
For more information, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide. c. For Subnet 1 and Subnet 2, enter the CIDR range for each subnet. 7. In the Tags section, specify the key and value for each tag to associate with the cluster. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources. 8. In the CloudWatch Container Insights section, choose whether to enable Container Insights for the cluster. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308). 9. Choose Create.
Note It can take up to 15 minutes for your Windows container instances to register with your cluster.
Step 2: Register a Windows task definition
Before you can run Windows containers in your Amazon ECS cluster, you must register a task definition. The following task definition example displays a simple webpage on port 8080 of a container instance with the mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis container image.
To register the sample task definition with the AWS Management Console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions. 3. On the Task Definitions page, choose Create new Task Definition. 4. On the Select launch type compatibilities page, choose Fargate, Next step. 5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose Configure via JSON. 6. Paste the sample task definition JSON below into the text area (replacing the pre-populated JSON
there) and choose Save.
Use one of the following for operatingSystemFamily:
· WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL · WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE
{ "containerDefinitions": [ { "command": [ "New-Item -Path C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\index.html -Type file -Value

7. Verify your information and choose Create.
To register the sample task definition with the AWS CLI
1. Create a file called windows_fargate_sample_app.json. 2. Open the file with your favorite text editor and add the sample JSON above to the file and save it.
3. Using the AWS CLI, run the following command to register the task definition with Amazon ECS.
Note Make sure that your AWS CLI is configured to use the same region that your Windows cluster exists in, or add the --region your_cluster_region option to your command.
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://windows_fargate_sample_app.json
Step 3: Create a service with your task definition
After you have registered your task definition, you can place tasks in your cluster with it. The following procedure creates a service with your task definition and places one task on your cluster.
28

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the classic console with
Windows containers on AWS Fargate To create a service from your task definition with the console 1. On the Task Definition: windows_fargate_sample_app registration confirmation page, choose
Actions, Create Service. 2. On the Create Service page, enter the following information and then choose Create service.
· Launch type: Fargate · Platform operating system: WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL or WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE · Cluster: windows · Service name: windows_fargate_sample_app · Service type: REPLICA · Number of tasks: 1 · Deployment type: Rolling update
To create a service from your task definition with the AWS CLI · Using the AWS CLI, run the following command to create your service.
aws ecs create-service --cluster windows --task-definition windows-simple-iis -desired-count 1 --service-name windows_fargate_sample_app
Step 4: View your service
After your service has launched a task into your cluster, you can view the service and open the IIS test page in a browser to verify that the container is running.
Note It can take up to 15 minutes for your container instance to download and extract the Windows container base layers. To view your service 1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. On the Clusters page, choose the windows cluster. 3. In the Services tab, choose the windows_fargate_sample_app service. 4. On the Service: windows_fargate_sample_app page, choose the task ID for the task in your service. 5. On the Task page, expand the windows_fargate container to view its information. 6. In the Network bindings of the container, you should see an External Link IP address and port combination link. Choose that link to open the IIS test page in your browser.
29

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the classic console with
Windows containers on AWS Fargate
Step 5: Clean Up
When you are finished using an Amazon ECS cluster, you should clean up the resources associated with it to avoid incurring charges for resources that you are not using. Some Amazon ECS resources, such as tasks, services, clusters, and container instances, are cleaned up using the Amazon ECS console. Other resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, and Auto Scaling groups, must be cleaned up manually in the Amazon EC2 console or by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack that created them. 1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, select the cluster to delete. 4. Choose Delete Cluster. At the confirmation prompt, enter delete me and then choose Delete.
Deleting the cluster cleans up the associated resources that were created with the cluster, including Auto Scaling groups, VPCs, or load balancers.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS Management Console
Amazon ECS developer tools overview
Whether you are part of a large enterprise or a startup, Amazon ECS offers a variety of tools that can help you to get your containers up and running quickly, regardless of your level of expertise. You can work with Amazon ECS in the following ways.
· Learn about, develop, manage and visualize your container applications and services using the AWS Management Console (p. 31).
· Perform specific actions to Amazon ECS resources with automated deployments through programming or scripts using the AWS Command Line Interface (p. 31), AWS SDKs (p. 34) or the ECS API.
· Define and manage all AWS resources in your environment with automated deployment using AWS CloudFormation (p. 32).
· Use the complete AWS Copilot CLI (p. 32) end-to-end developer workflow to create, release, and operate container applications that comply with AWS best practices for infrastructure.
· Using your preferred programming language, define infrastructure or architecture as code with the AWS CDK (p. 32).
· Containerize applications that are hosted on premises or on Amazon EC2 instances or both by using the AWS App2Container (p. 33) integrated portability and tooling ecosystem for containers.
· Deploy a Docker Compose application to Amazon ECS or test local containers with containers running in ECS, using the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 33).
· Launch containers from Docker Desktop integration with Amazon ECS (p. 33) using Amazon ECS in Docker Desktop.
AWS Management Console
The AWS Management Console is a browser-based interface for managing Amazon ECS resources. The console provides a visual overview of the service, making it easy to explore Amazon ECS features and functions without needing to use additional tools. Many related tutorials and walkthroughs are available that can guide you through use of the console.
For a tutorial that guides you through the console, see Getting started with Amazon ECS (p. 4).
When starting out, many customers prefer using the console because it provides instant visual feedback on whether the actions they take succeed. AWS customers that are familiar with the AWS Management Console, can easily manage related resources such as load balancers and Amazon EC2 instances.
Start with the AWS Management Console.
AWS Command Line Interface
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool that you can use to manage your AWS services. With this one tool alone, you can both control multiple AWS services and automate these services through scripts. The Amazon ECS commands in the AWS CLI are a reflection of the Amazon ECS API.
31

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS CloudFormation
AWS provides two sets of command line tools: the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide and the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell User Guide.
The AWS CLI is suitable for customers who prefer and are used to scripting and interfacing with a command line tool and know exactly which actions they want to perform on their Amazon ECS resources. The AWS CLI is also helpful to customers who want to familiarize themselves with the Amazon ECS APIs. Customers can use the AWS CLI to perform a number of operations on Amazon ECS resources, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, directly from the command line interface.
Use the AWS CLI if you are or want to become familiar with the Amazon ECS APIs and corresponding CLI commands and want to write automated scripts and perform specific actions on Amazon ECS resources.
AWS CloudFormation
AWS CloudFormation and Terraform for Amazon ECS both provide powerful ways for you to define your infrastructure as code. You can easily track which version of your template or AWS CloudFormation stack is running at any time and rollback to a previous version if needed. You can perform infrastructure and application deployments in the same automated fashion. This flexibility and automation is what makes AWS CloudFormation and Terraform two popular formats for deploying workloads to Amazon ECS from continuous delivery pipelines.
For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see Creating Amazon ECS resources with AWS CloudFormation (p. 395).
Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform if you want to automate infrastructure deployments and applications on Amazon ECS and explicitly define and manage all of the AWS resources in your environment.
AWS Copilot CLI
The AWS Copilot CLI (command line interface) is a comprehensive tool that enables customers to deploy and operate applications packaged in containers and environments on Amazon ECS directly from their source code. When using AWS Copilot you can perform these operations without understanding AWS and Amazon ECS elements such as Application Load Balancers, public subnets, tasks, services, and clusters. AWS Copilot creates AWS resources on your behalf from opinionated service patterns, such as a load balanced web service or backend service, providing an immediate production environment for containerized applications. You can deploy through an AWS CodePipeline pipeline across multiple environments, accounts, or Regions, all of which can be managed within the CLI. By using AWS Copilot you can also perform operator tasks, such as viewing logs and the health of your service. AWS Copilot is an all-in-one tool that helps you more easily manage your cloud resources so that you can focus on developing and managing your applications.
For more information, see Using the AWS Copilot command line interface (p. 35).
Use the AWS Copilot complete end-to-end developer workflow to create, release, and operate container applications that comply with AWS best practices for infrastructure.
AWS CDK
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open source software development framework that enables you to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.
32

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS App2Container
AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. Using the CDK, customers can generate their environment with fewer lines of code using the same language they used to build their application. Amazon ECS provides a module in the CDK that is named ecs-patterns, which creates common architectures. An available pattern is ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(). This pattern creates a cluster, task definition, and additional resources to run a load balanced Amazon ECS service on AWS Fargate.
For more information, see Getting started with Amazon ECS using the AWS CDK (p. 16).
Use the AWS CDK if you want to define infrastructure or architecture as code in your preferred programming language. For example, you can use the same language that you use to write your applications.
AWS App2Container
Sometimes enterprise customers might already have applications that are hosted on premises or on EC2 instances or both. They are interested in the portability and tooling ecosystem of containers specifically on Amazon ECS, and need to containerize first. AWS App2Container enables you to do just that. App2Container (A2C) is a command line tool for modernizing .NET and Java applications into containerized applications. A2C analyzes and builds an inventory of all applications running in virtual machines, on premises or in the cloud. After you select the application you want to containerize, A2C packages the application artifact and identified dependencies into container images. It then configures the network ports and generates the Amazon ECS task. Last, it creates a CloudFormation template that you can deploy or modify if needed.
For more information, see Getting started with AWS App2Container.
Use App2Container if you have applications that are hosted on premises or on Amazon EC2 instances or both.
Amazon ECS CLI
The Amazon ECS CLI enables you to run your applications on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate using the Docker Compose file format. You can quickly provision resources, push and pull images using Amazon ECR, and monitor running applications on Amazon ECS or AWS Fargate. You can also test containers running locally along with containers in the cloud within the CLI.
For more information, see Using the Amazon ECS command line interface (p. 41).
Use the ECS CLI if you have a Compose application and want to deploy it to Amazon ECS, or test local containers with containers running in Amazon ECS in the cloud.
Docker Desktop integration with Amazon ECS
AWS and Docker have collaborated to make a simplified developer experience that enables you to deploy and manage containers on Amazon ECS directly using Docker tools. You can now build and test your containers locally using Docker Desktop and Docker Compose, and then deploy them to Amazon ECS on Fargate. To get started with the Amazon ECS and Docker integration, download Docker Desktop and optionally sign up for a Docker ID. For more information, see Docker Desktop and Docker ID signup.
Beginners to containers often start learning about containers by using Docker tools such as the Docker CLI and Docker Compose. This makes using the Docker Compose CLI plugin for Amazon ECS a
33

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS SDKs
natural next step in running containers on AWS after testing locally. Docker provides a walkthrough on deploying containers on Amazon ECS. For more information, see Deploying Docker containers on Amazon ECS.
You can take advantage of additional Amazon ECS features, such as service discovery, load balancing and other AWS resources for use with their applications with Docker Desktop.
You can also download the Docker Compose CLI plugin for Amazon ECS directly from GitHub. For more information, see Docker Compose CLI plugin for Amazon ECS on GitHub.
AWS SDKs
You can also use AWS SDKs to manage Amazon ECS resources and operations from a variety of programming languages. The SDKs provide modules to help take care of tasks, including tasks in the following list.
· Cryptographically signing your service requests · Retrying requests · Handling error responses
For more information about the available SDKs, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
Summary
With the many options to choose from, you can choose the options that are best suited to you. Consider the following options.
· If you are visually oriented, you can visually create and operate containers using the AWS Management Console.
· If you prefer CLIs, consider using AWS Copilot or the AWS CLI. Alternatively, if you prefer the Docker ecosystem, you can take advantage of the functionality of ECS from within the Docker CLI to deploy to AWS. After these resources are deployed, you can continue managing them through the CLI or visually through the Console.
· If you are a developer, you can use the AWS CDK to define your infrastructure in the same language as your application. You can use the CDK and AWS Copilot to export to CloudFormation templates where you can change granular settings, add other AWS resources, and automate deployments through scripting or a CI/CD pipeline such as AWS CodePipeline.
The AWS CLI, SDKs, or ECS API are useful tools for automating actions on ECS resources, making them ideal for deployment. To deploy applications using AWS CloudFormation you can use a variety of programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision all the resources needed for your applications. You can then deploy your application across multiple Regions and accounts in an automated and secure manner. For example, you can define your ECS cluster, services, task definitions, or capacity providers, as code in a file and deploy through the AWS CLI CloudFormation commands.
To perform operations tasks, you can view and manage resources programmatically using the AWS CLI, SDK, or ECS API. Commands like describe-tasks or list-services display the latest metadata or a list of all resources. Similar to deployments, customers can write an automation that includes commands such as update-service to provide corrective action upon the detection of a resource that has stopped unexpectedly. You can also operate your services using AWS Copilot. Commands like copilot svc

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the AWS Copilot CLI
logs or copilot app show provide details about each of your microservices, or about your application as a whole.
Customers can use any of the available tooling mentioned in this document and use them in variety of combinations. ECS tooling offers various paths to graduate from certain tools to use others that fit your changing needs. For example, you can opt for more granular control over resources or more automation as needed. ECS also offers a large range of tools for a wide range of needs and levels of expertise.
Using the AWS Copilot command line interface
The AWS Copilot command line interface (CLI) commands simplify building, releasing, and operating production-ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS from a local development environment. The AWS Copilot CLI aligns with developer workflows that support modern application best practices: from using infrastructure as code to creating a CI/CD pipeline provisioned on behalf of a user. Use the AWS Copilot CLI as part of your everyday development and testing cycle as an alternative to the AWS Management Console.
AWS Copilot currently supports Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. For more information about the latest version of the AWS Copilot CLI, see Releases.
Note The source code for the AWS Copilot CLI is available on GitHub. The latest CLI documentation is available on the AWS Copilot website. We recommend that you submit issues and pull requests for changes that you would like to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of AWS Copilot code. Report issues with AWS Copilot by connecting with us on Gitter or GitHub where you can open issues, provide feedback, and report bugs.

Next steps
After installation, learn how to deploy an Amazon ECS application using AWS Copilot. For more information, see Getting started with Amazon ECS using AWS Copilot (p. 11).
Using the Amazon ECS command line interface
Amazon ECS has released AWS Copilot, a command line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies building, releasing, and operating production-ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS from a local development environment. For more information, see Using the AWS Copilot command line interface (p. 35).
The Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) command line interface (CLI) provides high-level commands to simplify creating, updating, and monitoring clusters and tasks from a local development environment. The Amazon ECS CLI supports Docker Compose files, a popular open-source specification for defining and running multi-container applications. Use the ECS CLI as part of your everyday development and testing cycle as an alternative to the AWS Management Console.
Important At this time, the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI only supports the major versions of Docker Compose file syntax versions 1, 2, and 3. The version specified in the compose file must be the string "1", "1.0", "2", "2.0", "3", or "3.0". Docker Compose minor versions are not supported. The latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI is 1.17.0. For release notes, see Changelog. Note The source code for the Amazon ECS CLI is available on GitHub. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you would like to have included. However, Amazon Web Services does not currently support running modified copies of this software. Learn how to use high-level, application-first commands to model, create, release and manage containerized applications from a local development environment at Getting started with Amazon ECS using AWS Copilot (p. 11).

local development environment. For more information, see Using the AWS Copilot command line interface (p. 35).
Follow these instructions to install the Amazon ECS CLI on your macOS, Linux, or Windows system.
Step 1: Download the Amazon ECS CLI
Download the Amazon ECS CLI binary. macOS
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-clidarwin-amd64-latest
Linux
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-clilinux-amd64-latest
Windows Open Windows PowerShell and enter the following commands. Note If you encounter permission issues, ensure that you have administrator access on Windows and you are running PowerShell as an administrator.
New-Item -Path 'C:\Program Files\Amazon\ECSCLI' -ItemType Directory Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile 'C:\Program Files\Amazon\ECSCLI\ecs-cli.exe' https://amazonecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-cli-windows-amd64-latest.exe
Step 2: Verify the Amazon ECS CLI using PGP signatures
The Amazon ECS CLI executables are cryptographically signed using PGP signatures. The PGP signatures can be used to verify the validity of the Amazon ECS CLI executable. Use the following steps to verify the signatures using the GnuPG tool. 1. Download and install GnuPG. For more information, see the GnuPG website.
macOS We recommend using Homebrew. Install Homebrew using the instructions from their website. For more information, see Homebrew. After Homebrew is installed, use the following command from your macOS terminal.
brew install gnupg
Linux Install gpg using the package manager on your flavor of Linux.
Windows Download the Windows simple installer from the GnuPG website and install as an Administrator. After you install GnuPG, close and reopen the Administrator PowerShell.
42

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Installing the Amazon ECS CLI
For more information, see GnuPG Download. 2. Verify the GnuPG path is added to your environment path.
macOS
echo $PATH
If you do not see the GnuPG path in the output, run the following command to add it to the path.
PATH=$PATH:<path to GnuPG executable files>
Linux
echo $PATH
If you do not see the GnuPG path in the output, run the following command to add it to the path.
export PATH=$PATH:<path to GnuPG executable files>
Windows
Write-Output $Env:PATH
If you do not see the GnuPG path in the output, run the following command to add it to the path.
e $Env:PATH += ";<path to GnuPG executable files>"
3. Create a local plain text file. macOS On the terminal, enter:
touch <public_key_filename.txt>
Open the file with TextEdit. Linux
Create a text file in a text editor such as gedit. Save as public_key_filename.txt Windows
Create a text file in a text editor such as Notepad. Save as public_key_filename.txt 4. Add the following contents of the Amazon ECS PGP public key and save the file.

Windows Edit the environment variables and add C:\Program Files\Amazon\ECSCLI to the PATH variable field, separated from existing entries by using a semicolon. For example:
setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\Amazon\ECSCLI"
Restart PowerShell so the changes go into effect. Note After the PATH variable is set, the Amazon ECS CLI can be used from either Windows PowerShell or the command prompt.
Step 4: Complete the Installation
Verify that the CLI is working properly.
ecs-cli --version
Proceed to Configuring the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 47). Important You must configure the Amazon ECS CLI with your AWS credentials, an AWS Region, and an Amazon ECS cluster name before you can use it.
Configuring the Amazon ECS CLI
Amazon ECS has released AWS Copilot, a command line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies building, releasing, and operating production-ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS from a local development environment. For more information, see Using the AWS Copilot command line interface (p. 35).
The Amazon ECS CLI requires some basic configuration information before you can use it, such as your AWS credentials, the AWS Region in which to create your cluster, and the name of the Amazon ECS cluster to use. Configuration information is stored in the ~/.ecs directory on macOS and Linux systems and in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\local\ecs on Windows systems. To configure the Amazon ECS CLI 1. Set up a CLI profile with the following command, substituting profile_name with your desired
profile name, $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables with your AWS credentials.
ecs-cli configure profile --profile-name profile_name --access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret-key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
47

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Configuring the Amazon ECS CLI
2. Complete the configuration with the following command, substituting launch_type with the task launch type you want to use by default, region_name with your desired AWS Region, cluster_name with the name of an existing Amazon ECS cluster or a new cluster to use, and configuration_name for the name you'd like to give this configuration.
ecs-cli configure --cluster cluster_name --default-launch-type launch_type -region region_name --config-name configuration_name
After you have installed and configured the CLI, you can try the Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate task using the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 50). For more information, see the Amazon ECS Command Line Reference in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Profiles
The Amazon ECS CLI supports the configuring of multiple sets of AWS credentials as named profiles using the ecs-cli configure profile command. A default profile can be set by using the ecs-cli configure profile default command. These profiles can then be referenced when you run Amazon ECS CLI commands that require credentials using the --ecs-profile flag otherwise the default profile is used.
For more information, see the Amazon ECS Command Line Reference in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Cluster Configurations
A cluster configuration is a set of fields that describes an Amazon ECS cluster including the name of the cluster and the region. A default cluster configuration can be set by using the ecs-cli configure default command. The Amazon ECS CLI supports the configuring of multiple named cluster configurations using the --config-name option.
For more information, see the Amazon ECS Command Line Reference in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Order of Precedence
There are multiple methods for passing both the credentials and the region in an Amazon ECS CLI command. The following is the order of precedence for each of these.
The order of precedence for credentials is:
1. Amazon ECS CLI profile flags: a. Amazon ECS profile (--ecs-profile) b. AWS profile (--aws-profile)
2. Environment variables: a. ECS_PROFILE b. AWS_PROFILE c. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
3. ECS config-attempts to fetch credentials from the default ECS profile. 4. Default AWS profile -- Attempts to use credentials (aws_access_key_id,
aws_secret_access_key) or assume_role (role_arn, source_profile) from the AWS profile name. a. AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE environment variable (defaults to default). 5. EC2 instance role
48

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Migrating Configuration Files
The order of precedence for Region is:
1. Amazon ECS CLI flags: a. Region flag (--region) b. Cluster config flag (--cluster-config)
2. ECS config-attempts to fetch the Region from the default ECS profile. 3. Environment variables--Attempts to fetch the region from the following environment variables:
a. AWS_REGION b. AWS_DEFAULT_REGION 4. AWS profile - attempts to use the region from the AWS profile name: a. AWS_PROFILE environment variable b. AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE environment variable (defaults to default)
Migrating Configuration Files
The process of configuring the Amazon ECS CLI has changed significantly in the latest version (v1.0.0) to allow the addition of new features. A migration command has been introduced that converts an older (v0.6.6 and older) configuration file to the current format. The old configuration files are deprecated, so we recommend converting your configuration to the newest format to take advantage of the new features. The configuration-related changes and new features introduced in v1.0.0 in the new YAML formatted configuration files include:
· Splitting up of credential and cluster-related configuration information into two separate files. Credential information is stored in ~/.ecs/credentials and cluster configuration information is stored in ~/.ecs/config.
· The configuration files are formatted in YAML. · Support for storing multiple named configurations. · Deprecation of the field compose-service-name-prefix (name used for creating a service
<compose_service_name_prefix> + <project_name>). This field can still be configured. However, if it is not configured, there is no longer a default value assigned. For Amazon ECS CLI v0.6.6 and earlier, the default was ecscompose-service-. · Removal of the field compose-project-name-prefix (name used for creating a task definition <compose_project_name_prefix> + <project_name>). Amazon ECS CLI v1.0.0 and later can still read old configuration files; so if this field is present then it is still read and used. However, configuring this field is not supported in v1.0.0+ with the ecs-cli configure command, and if the field is manually added to a v1.0.0+ configuration file it causes the Amazon ECS CLI to throw an error. · The field cfn-stack-name-prefix (name used for creating CFN stacks <cfn_stack_name_prefix> + <cluster_name>) has been changed to cfn-stack-name. Instead of specifying a prefix, the exact name of a CloudFormation template can be configured. · Amazon ECS CLI v0.6.6 and earlier allowed configuring credentials using a named AWS profile from the ~/.aws/credentials file on your system. This functionality has been removed. However, a new flag, --aws-profile, has been added which allows the referencing of an AWS profile inline in all commands that require credentials.
Note The --project-name flag can be used to set the project name.
Migrating Older Configuration Files to the v1.0.0+ Format
While all versions of the Amazon ECS CLI support reading from the older configuration file format, upgrading to the new format is required to take advantage of some new features, for example using
49

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a
Fargate task using the Amazon ECS CLI
multiple named cluster profiles. Migrating your legacy configuration file to the new format is easy with the ecs-cli configure migrate command. The command takes the configuration information stored in the old format in ~/.ecs/config and converts it to a pair of files in the new format, overwriting your old configuration file in the process.
When running the ecs-cli configure migrate command there is a warning message displayed with the old configuration file, and a preview of the new configuration files. User confirmation is required before the migration proceeds. If the --force flag is used, then the warning message is not displayed, and the migration proceeds without any confirmation. If cfn-stack-name-prefix is used in the legacy file, then cfn-stack-name is stored in the new file as <cfn_stack_name_prefix> + <cluster_name>.
For more information, see the Amazon ECS Command Line Reference in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate task using the Amazon ECS CLI
This tutorial shows you how to set up a cluster and deploy a service with tasks using the Fargate launch type.
Prerequisites
Complete the following prerequisites:
· Set up an AWS account. · Install the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 41). · Install and configure the AWS CLI. For more information, see AWS Command Line Interface. · Optional: AWS CloudShell is a tool that gives customers a command line without needing to create
their own EC2 instance. For more information, see What is AWS CloudShell in the AWS CloudShell User Guide.
Step 1: Create the Task Execution IAM Role
The Amazon ECS container agent makes calls to AWS APIs on your behalf, so it requires an IAM policy and role for the service to know that the agent belongs to you. This IAM role is referred to as a task execution IAM role. If you already have a task execution role created to use, you can skip this step. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
To create the task execution IAM role using the AWS CLI
1. Create a file named task-execution-assume-role.json with the following contents:
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com" }, "Action": "sts:AssumeRole" } ]
50

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a
Fargate task using the Amazon ECS CLI
}
2. Create the task execution role:
aws iam --region us-west-2 create-role --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --assume-rolepolicy-document file://task-execution-assume-role.json
3. Attach the task execution role policy:
aws iam --region us-west-2 attach-role-policy --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole -policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
Step 2: Configure the Amazon ECS CLI
The Amazon ECS CLI requires credentials in order to make API requests on your behalf. It can pull credentials from environment variables, an AWS profile, or an Amazon ECS profile. For more information, see Configuring the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 47).
To create an Amazon ECS CLI configuration 1. Create a cluster configuration, which defines the AWS region to use, resource creation prefixes, and
the cluster name to use with the Amazon ECS CLI:
ecs-cli configure --cluster tutorial --default-launch-type FARGATE --configname tutorial --region us-west-2
2. Create a CLI profile using your access key and secret key:
ecs-cli configure profile --access-key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secretkey AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --profile-name tutorial-profile
Step 3: Create a Cluster and Configure the Security Group
To create an ECS cluster and security group 1. Create an Amazon ECS cluster with the ecs-cli up command. Because you specified Fargate as your
default launch type in the cluster configuration, this command creates an empty cluster and a VPC configured with two public subnets.
ecs-cli up --cluster-config tutorial --ecs-profile tutorial-profile
This command may take a few minutes to complete as your resources are created. The output of this command contains the VPC and subnet IDs that are created.
Note Make a note of these IDs as you will need them in the following steps. 2. Using the AWS CLI, retrieve the default security group ID for the VPC. Use the VPC ID from the previous output:
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=VPC_ID --region us-west-2
The output of this command contains your security group ID, which is used in the next step. 3. Using AWS CLI, add a security group rule to allow inbound access on port 80:
51

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a
Fargate task using the Amazon ECS CLI
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id security_group_id --protocol tcp -port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 --region us-west-2
Step 4: Create a Compose File
For this step, create a simple Docker compose file that creates a simple PHP web application. At this time, the Amazon ECS CLI supports Docker compose file syntax versions 1, 2, and 3. The version specified in the compose file must be the string "1", "1.0", "2", "2.0", "3", or "3.0". Docker Compose minor versions are not supported.
Here is the compose file, which you can name docker-compose.yml. The web container exposes port 80 for inbound traffic to the web server. It also configures container logs to go to the CloudWatch log group created earlier. This is the recommended best practice for Fargate tasks.
version: '3' services:
web: image: amazon/amazon-ecs-sample ports: - "80:80" logging: driver: awslogs options: awslogs-group: tutorial awslogs-region: us-west-2 awslogs-stream-prefix: web
Note If your account already contains a CloudWatch Logs log group named tutorial in the uswest-2 Region, choose a unique name so the ECS CLI creates a new log group for this tutorial.
In addition to the Docker compose information, there are some parameters specific to Amazon ECS that you must specify for the service. Using the VPC, subnet, and security group IDs from the previous step, create a file named ecs-params.yml with the following content:
version: 1 task_definition:
task_execution_role: ecsTaskExecutionRole ecs_network_mode: awsvpc os_family: Linux task_size:
mem_limit: 0.5GB cpu_limit: 256 run_params: network_configuration: awsvpc_configuration:
subnets: - "subnet ID 1" - "subnet ID 2"
security_groups: - "security group ID"
assign_public_ip: ENABLED
Step 5: Deploy the Compose File to a Cluster
After you create the compose file, you can deploy it to your cluster with ecs-cli compose service up. By default, the command looks for files called docker-compose.yml and ecs-params.yml in the current
52

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a
Fargate task using the Amazon ECS CLI
directory; you can specify a different docker compose file with the --file option, and a different ECS Params file with the --ecs-params option. By default, the resources created by this command have the current directory in their titles, but you can override that with the --project-name option. The -create-log-groups option creates the CloudWatch log groups for the container logs.

ecs-cli compose --project-name tutorial service up --create-log-groups --clusterconfig tutorial --ecs-profile tutorial-profile

Step 6: View the Running Containers on a Cluster
After you deploy the compose file, you can view the containers that are running in the service with ecscli compose service ps.

ecs-cli compose --project-name tutorial service ps --cluster-config tutorial --ecsprofile tutorial-profile

Output:

Name

TaskDefinition Health

tutorial/0c2862e6e39e4eff92ca3e4f843c5b9a/web

tutorial:1

UNKNOWN

State RUNNING

Ports 34.222.202.55:80->80/tcp

In the above example, you can see the web container from your compose file, and also the IP address and port of the web server. If you point your web browser at that address, you should see the PHP web application. Also in the output is the task-id value for the container. Copy the task ID as you use it in the next step.
Step 7: View the Container Logs
View the logs for the task:

ecs-cli logs --task-id 0c2862e6e39e4eff92ca3e4f843c5b9a --follow --cluster-config tutorial --ecs-profile tutorial-profile
Note The --follow option tells the Amazon ECS CLI to continuously poll for logs.
Step 8: Scale the Tasks on the Cluster
You can scale up your task count to increase the number of instances of your application with ecs-cli compose service scale.

ecs-cli compose --project-name tutorial service scale 2 --cluster-config tutorial --ecsprofile tutorial-profile

In this example, the running count of the application is increased to two.

ecs-cli compose --project-name tutorial service ps --cluster-config tutorial --ecsprofile tutorial-profile

Output:

Step 9: View your Web Application
Enter the IP address for the task in your web browser and you should see a webpage that displays the Simple PHP App web application.

Step 10: Clean Up
When you are done with this tutorial, you should clean up your resources so they do not incur any more charges. First, delete the service so that it stops the existing containers and does not try to run any more tasks.
ecs-cli compose --project-name tutorial service down --cluster-config tutorial --ecsprofile tutorial-profile
Now, take down your cluster, which cleans up the resources that you created earlier with ecs-cli up.
ecs-cli down --force --cluster-config tutorial --ecs-profile tutorial-profile
Tutorial: Creating an Amazon ECS Service That Uses Service Discovery Using the Amazon ECS CLI
This tutorial shows a simple walkthrough of creating an Amazon ECS service that is configured to use service discovery. Many of the service discovery configuration values can be specified with either the ECS parameters file or flags. When flags are used, they take precedence over the ECS parameters file if both are present. When using the Amazon ECS CLI, the compose project name is used as the name for your ECS service.
Prerequisites
It is expected that you have completed the following prerequisites before continuing on: · Set up an AWS account. · Install the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 41).
54

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating an Amazon ECS Service That Uses Service Discovery Using the Amazon ECS CLI
· Create a VPC. For more information, see the section called "Create a virtual private cloud" (p. 6).
· Optional: AWS CloudShell is a tool that gives customers a command line without needing to create their own EC2 instance. For more information, see What is AWS CloudShell in the AWS CloudShell User Guide.

Configure the Amazon ECS CLI
Before you can start this tutorial, you must install and configure the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 41).
The Amazon ECS CLI requires credentials in order to make API requests on your behalf. It can pull credentials from environment variables, an AWS profile, or an Amazon ECS profile. For more information, see Configuring the Amazon ECS CLI (p. 47).
To create an Amazon ECS CLI configuration
1. Create a cluster configuration:
ecs-cli configure --cluster ec2-tutorial --region us-east-1 --default-launch-type EC2 --config-name ec2-tutorial
2. Create a profile using your access key and secret key:
ecs-cli configure profile --access-key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secretkey AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --profile-name ec2-tutorial
Note If this is the first time that you are configuring the Amazon ECS CLI, these configurations are marked as default. If this is not your first time configuring the Amazon ECS CLI, see the Amazon ECS Command Line Reference in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide to set this as the default configuration and profile.

Create an Amazon ECS Service Configured to Use Service Discovery
Use the following steps to create an Amazon ECS service that is configured to use service discovery with the Amazon ECS CLI.
To create an Amazon ECS service configured to use service discovery
1. Create an Amazon ECS service named backend and create a private DNS namespace named tutorial within a VPC. In this example, the task is using the awsvpc network mode, so the container_name and container_port values are not required.

ecs-cli compose --project-name backend service up --private-dns-namespace tutorial -vpc vpc-04deee8176dce7d7d --enable-service-discovery

Output:

INFO[0001] Using ECS task definition

serviceName=backend

2. Create another service named frontend in the same private DNS namespace. Because the namespace already exists, the Amazon ECS CLI uses it instead of creating a new one.

ecs-cli compose --project-name frontend service up --private-dns-namespace tutorial -vpc vpc-04deee8176dce7d7d --enable-service-discovery

Output:

INFO[0001] Using ECS task definition

TaskDefinition="frontend:1"

INFO[0157] Service status

desiredCount=1 runningCount=1

serviceName=frontend

INFO[0157] ECS Service has reached a stable state

desiredCount=1 runningCount=1

serviceName=frontend

3. Verify that the two services are able to discover each other within the VPC using DNS. The DNS hostname uses the following format: <service_discovery_service_name>.<service_discovery_namespace>. For this example, the frontend service can be discovered at frontend.tutorial and the backend service can be discovered at backend.tutorial. Because these are private DNS namespaces, these DNS names only resolve when within the specified VPC.
4. To update the service discovery settings, update the settings for the frontend service. The values that can be updated are the DNS TTL and the value for the health check custom config failure threshold.

ecs-cli compose --project-name frontend service up --update-service-discovery --dnstype SRV --dns-ttl 120 --healthcheck-custom-config-failure-threshold 2

Output:

INFO[0001] Using ECS task definition

TaskDefinition="frontend:1"

INFO[0001] Updated ECS service successfully

56

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating an Amazon ECS Service That Uses Service Discovery Using the Amazon ECS CLI

INFO[0002] Cloudformation stack status

stackStatus=UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS

5. To clean up, delete the Amazon ECS service and the service discovery resources. When the
frontend service is deleted, the Amazon ECS CLI automatically removes the associated service discovery service.

ecs-cli compose --project-name frontend service rm

INFO[0000] Updated ECS service successfully

desiredCount=0

serviceName=frontend

INFO[0001] Service status

desiredCount=0 runningCount=1

serviceName=frontend

INFO[0027] Waiting for your Service Discovery Service resource to be deleted...

INFO[0027] Cloudformation stack status

stackStatus=DELETE_IN_PROGRESS

6. To complete the cleanup, delete the backend service along with the private DNS namespace that was created with it. The Amazon ECS CLI associates the AWS CloudFormation stack for the private DNS namespace with the Amazon ECS service for which it was created. When the service is deleted, the namespace is also deleted.

ecs-cli compose --project-name backend service rm --delete-namespace

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Linux platform versions
AWS Fargate platform versions
AWS Fargate platform versions are used to refer to a specific runtime environment for Fargate task infrastructure. It is a combination of the kernel and container runtime versions.
New platform versions are released as the runtime environment evolves, for example, if there are kernel or operating system updates, new features, bug fixes, or security updates. Security updates and patches are deployed automatically for your Fargate tasks. If a security issue is found that affects a platform version, AWS patches the platform version. In some cases, you may be notified that your Fargate tasks have been scheduled for retirement. For more information, Task maintenance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate. Topics
· Linux platform versions (p. 58) · Windows platform versions (p. 62)
Linux platform versions
Platform version considerations
The following should be considered when specifying a platform version: · When specifying a platform version, you can use either a specific version number, for example 1.4.0,
or LATEST. When the LATEST platform version is selected, 1.4.0 platform version is used. · In the China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) Regions, the only supported platform versions are 1.4.0 and 1.3.0. The AWS Management Console displays older platform versions but an error will be returned if they are chosen. The LATEST platform version is supported because it uses the 1.4.0 platform version. · If you have a service with running tasks and want to update their platform version, you can update your service, specify a new platform version, and choose Force new deployment. Your tasks are redeployed with the latest platform version. For more information, see Updating a service (p. 237). · If your service is scaled up without updating the platform version, those tasks receive the platform version that was specified on the service's current deployment.
The following are the available Linux platform versions. For information about platform version deprecation, see AWS Fargate platform version deprecation (p. 61).
1.4.0
The following is the changelog for platform version 1.4.0. · Beginning on November 5, 2020, any new Amazon ECS task launched on Fargate using platform
version 1.4.0 will be able to use the following features:
58

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate 1.3.0
· When using Secrets Manager to store sensitive data, you can inject a specific JSON key or a specific version of a secret as an environment variable or in a log configuration. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager (p. 176).
· Specify environment variables in bulk using the environmentFiles container definition parameter. For more information, see Specifying environment variables (p. 186).
· Tasks run in a VPC and subnet enabled for IPv6 will be assigned both a private IPv4 address and an IPv6 address. For more information, see Fargate task networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.
· The task metadata endpoint version 4 provides additional metadata about your task and container including the task launch type, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container, and the log driver and log driver options used. When querying the /stats endpoint you also receive network rate stats for your containers. For more information, see Task metadata endpoint version 4 in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.
· Beginning on July 30, 2020, any new Amazon ECS task launched on Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 will be able to route UDP traffic using a Network Load Balancer to their Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks. For more information, see Service load balancing (p. 252).
· Beginning on May 28, 2020, any new Amazon ECS task launched on Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 will have its ephemeral storage encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm using an AWS owned encryption key. For more information, see Using data volumes in tasks (p. 127).
· Added support for using Amazon EFS file system volumes for persistent task storage. For more information, see Amazon EFS volumes (p. 129).
· The ephemeral task storage has been increased to a minimum of 20 GB for each task. For more information, see Using data volumes in tasks (p. 127).
· The network traffic behavior to and from tasks has been updated. Starting with platform version 1.4.0, all Fargate tasks receive a single elastic network interface (referred to as the task ENI) and all network traffic flows through that ENI within your VPC and will be visible to you through your VPC flow logs. For more information, see Fargate task networking (p. 136).
· Task ENIs add support for jumbo frames. Network interfaces are configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU), which is the size of the largest payload that fits within a single frame. The larger the MTU, the more application payload can fit within a single frame, which reduces per-frame overhead and increases efficiency. Supporting jumbo frames will reduce overhead when the network path between your task and the destination supports jumbo frames, such as all traffic that remains within your VPC.
· CloudWatch Container Insights will include network performance metrics for Fargate tasks. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
· Added support for the task metadata endpoint version 4 which provides additional information for your Fargate tasks, including network stats for the task and which Availability Zone the task is running in. For more information, see Task metadata endpoint version 4 (p. 380).
· Added support for the SYS_PTRACE Linux parameter in container definitions. For more information, see Linux parameters (p. 115).
· The Fargate container agent replaces the use of the Amazon ECS container agent for all Fargate tasks. This change should not have an effect on how your tasks run.
· The container runtime is now using Containerd instead of Docker. This change should not have an effect on how your tasks run. You will notice that some error messages that originate with the container runtime will change from mentioning Docker to more general errors. For more information, see Stopped tasks error codes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.
· Based on Amazon Linux 2.

Migrating to platform version 1.4.0
The following should be considered when migrating your Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks from platform version 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, or 1.3.0 to platform version 1.4.0. It is considered best practice to confirm your task works properly on platform version 1.4.0 prior to migrating your tasks.
· The network traffic behavior to and from tasks has been updated. Starting with platform version 1.4.0, all Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks receive a single elastic network interface (referred to as the task ENI) and all network traffic flows through that ENI within your VPC and will be visible to you through your VPC flow logs. For more information, see Fargate task networking (p. 136).
· If you are using interface VPC endpoints, the following should be considered. · When using container images hosted with Amazon ECR, both the com.amazonaws.region.ecr.dkr and com.amazonaws.region.ecr.api Amazon ECR VPC endpoints as well as the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint are required. For more information, see Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide. · When using a task definition that references Secrets Manager secrets to retrieve sensitive data for your containers, you must create the interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager. For more information, see Using Secrets Manager with VPC Endpoints in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. · When using a task definition that references Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters to retrieve sensitive data for your containers, you must create the interface VPC endpoints for Systems Manager. For more information, see Using Systems Manager with VPC endpoints in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. · Ensure that the security group in the Elastic Network Interface (ENI) associated with your task has the security group rules created to allow traffic between the task and the VPC endpoints you are using.
AWS Fargate platform version deprecation
This page lists platform versions that AWS Fargate has deprecated or have been scheduled for deprecation. These platform versions remain available until the published deprecation date.
A force update date is provided for each platform version scheduled for deprecation. On the force update date, any service using the LATEST platform version that is pointed to a platform version that is scheduled for deprecation will be updated using the force new deployment option. When the service is updated using the force new deployment option, all tasks running on a platform version scheduled for deprecation are stopped and new tasks are launched using the platform version that the LATEST tag points to at that time. Standalone tasks or services with an explicit platform version set are not affected by the force update date.
We recommend updating your services standalone tasks to use the most recent platform version. For more information on migrating to the most recent platform version, see Migrating to platform version 1.4.0 (p. 61).

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Cluster management in the new Amazon ECS console
New Amazon Elastic Container Service console
Amazon ECS has a new version of the console that is currently in development. the goal of the new console is to simplify deploying container to Amazon ECS by providing smarter defaults, and help panels which guide you through the Amazon ECS configuration process. You can manage clusters, task definitions, tasks, and services using the new console.
Topics · Cluster management in the new Amazon ECS console (p. 63) · Task definition management in the new Amazon ECS console (p. 65) · Task management in the new Amazon ECS console (p. 70) · Service management in the new Amazon ECS console (p. 72)
Cluster management in the new Amazon ECS console
The following cluster actions are available:
· Create a task for the Fargate launch type · Set the default capacity provider · Delete a cluster
Creating a cluster for the Fargate launch type using the new console
You can create an Amazon ECS cluster using the new AWS Management Console, as described in this topic. Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4). The new console provides a simple way to create the resources that are needed by an Amazon ECS cluster by creating a AWS CloudFormation stack. To make the cluster creation process as easy as possible, the console has default selections for many choices which we describe below. There are also help panels available for most of the sections in the console which provide further context. By default, we create an Amazon ECS cluster for Fargate launch type with the following properties:
· Uses Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers. · Launches tasks and services in all the default subnets in the default VPC for your selected Region. · Does not use Container Insights. · Has three tags configured for AWS CloudFormation.
You can modify the following default options:
· Change the subnets where tasks and services launch into by default.
63

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Setting the cluster default capacity provider using the new console
· Turn on Container Insights.
CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, that you use to isolate issues and resolve them quickly. For more information, see the section called "CloudWatch Container Insights" (p. 308). · Add tags to help you identify your clusters.
To create a new cluster (New Amazon ECS console)
Before you begin, be sure that you create an IAM user, and then assign the appropriate IAM permissions. For more information, see the section called "Create an IAM user" (p. 4) and the section called "Cluster examples" (p. 336).
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. From the navigation bar, select the Region to use. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 4. On the Clusters page, choose Create cluster. 5. Under Cluster configuration, for Cluster name, enter a unique name.
The name can contain up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and hyphens. 6. (Optional) To change the VPC and subnets where your tasks and services launch, under Networking,
perform any of the following operations:
· To remove a subnet, under Subnets, choose X for each subnet that you want to remove. · To change to a VPC other than the default VPC, under VPC, choose an existing VPC, and then
under Subnets, select each subnet. 7. (Optional) To turn on Container Insights, expand Monitoring, and then turn on Use Container
Insights. 8. (Optional) To manage the cluster tags, expand Tags, and then perform one of the following
operations:
[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
· For Key, enter the key name. · For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Choose Remove to the right of the tag's Key and Value. 9. Choose Create.
Setting the cluster default capacity provider using the new console
After the cluster creation completes, you can set the default capacity provider for the cluster. The capacity provider determines the infrastructure that your tasks and services run on.
To set the default capacity provider for the cluster (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, choose the cluster.

4. On the Cluster : name page, choose Edit. You are taken to the classic console.
5. On the Update cluster page, choose Add another provider. 6. For Provider 1, choose the capacity provider, and then choose Update. 7. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters.
You are returned to the new console.
Deleting a cluster using the new console
If you are finished using a cluster, you can delete it. After you delete the cluster, it transitions to the INACTIVE state. Clusters with an INACTIVE status may remain discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE clusters persisting.
Before you delete a cluster, you must perform the following operations:
· Delete all services in the cluster. For more information, see the section called "Deleting a service" (p. 239).
· Stop all currently running tasks. For more information, see the section called "Stopping tasks using the new console" (p. 84).
· If you created your cluster with the new console, delete the AWS CloudFormation stack that was created for your cluster. The stack is named cluster-name-ECS-Infra. For example, if the cluster name is "example-cluster-new-console", then the stack name is example-cluster-new-consoleECS-Infra. For more information, see Deleting a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
If you created a cluster using the classic console and you receive an error when you use the new console, you might need to delete the cluster using the classic console, For more information, see the section called "Deleting a cluster using the classic console" (p. 83).
To delete a cluster (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, select the Region to use. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 4. On the Clusters page, select the cluster to delete. 5. In the upper-right of the page, choose Delete Cluster.

65

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a task definition using the new console
Creating a task definition using the new console
Create your task definitions using the new Amazon ECS console experience. To make the task definition creation process as easy as possible, the console has default selections for many choices which we describe below. There are also help panels available for most of the sections in the console which provide further context.
To create a new task definition (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Task definitions, Create new task definition. 3. For Task definition family, specify a unique name for the task definition. 4. For each container to define in your task definition, complete the following steps.
a. For Name, specify a name for the container. b. For Image URI, specify the image to use to start a container. Images in the Amazon ECR Public
Gallery registry are may be specified using the Amazon ECR Public registry name only. For example, if public.ecr.aws/ecs/amazon-ecs-agent:latest is specified, the Amazon Linux container hosted on Amazon ECR Public Gallery is used. For all other repositories, specify the repository using either the repository-url/image:tag or repository-url/ image@digest formats. c. For Essential container, if your task definition has two or more containers defined, you may specify whether the container should be considered essential. If a container is marked as essential, if that container stops then the task is stopped. Each task definition must contain at least one essential container. d. A port mapping allows the container to access ports on the host to send or receive traffic. Under Port mappings, do one of the following:
· When you use the awsvpc network mode, for Container port and Protocol, specify the port mapping to use for the container.
· When you use the bridge network mode, for Container port and Protocol, specify the port mapping to use for the container. You select the bridge network mode on the next page. After you select it, choose Previous, and then for Host port, specify the port number on the container instance to reserve for your container.
Choose Add more port mappings to specify additional container port mappings. e. Expand the Environment variables section to specify environment variables to inject into the
container. You can specify environment variables either individually using key-value pairs or in bulk by specifying an environment variable file hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. For information on how to format an environment variable file, see Specifying environment variables (p. 186). f. (Optional) Choose Add more containers to add additional containers to the task definition. Choose Next once all containers have been defined. 5. For App environment, choose AWS Fargate (serverless), Amazon EC2 instances, or both. Amazon ECS performs validation using this value to ensure the task definition parameters are valid for the infrastructure type. 6. For Operating system/Architecture, choose the operating system and CPU architecture for the task.
To run your task on a 64-bit ARM architecture, select Linux/ARM64. For more information, see the section called "Runtime platform" (p. 98).

For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2, supported task CPU values are between 128 CPU units (0.125 vCPUs) and 10240 CPU units (10 vCPUs).
Note Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. 8. Expand the Container size section to specify the amount (in GB) of memory to present to the container and the number of CPU units the Amazon ECS container agent will reserve for the container.
If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task Memory value, if one is specified.
The total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task-level CPU value.
You can multiply the specified value by 1024 to determine the number of CPU units that are available per Amazon EC2 instance type. For example, the value for a t3 nano instance is 2048. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Instances . 9. (Optional) Expand the Task roles, network mode section to specify the following:
a. For Task role, choose the an IAM role to assign to the task. A task IAM role provides permissions for the containers in a task to call AWS APIs.
b. For Network mode, choose the network mode to use. The default is awsvpc mode. For more information, see Amazon ECS task networking.
If you choose bridge for the network mode, choose Previous, and then under Port mappings, for Host port, specify the port number on the container instance to reserve for your container. 10. (Optional) The Storage section is used to expand the amount of ephemeral storage for tasks hosted on Fargate as well as add a data volume configuration for the task.

Once the task definition is complete, choose Create to register the task definition.
Updating a task definition using the new console
A task definition revision is a copy of the current task definition with the new parameter values replacing the existing ones. All parameters that you do not modify are in the new revision.
To update a task definition, create a task definition revision. If the task definition is used in a service, you must update that service to use the updated task definition.
When you create a revision, you can modify the following container properties and environment properties.
· Container image URI · Port mappings · Environment variables · Task size · Container size
To create a task definition revision (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains your task definition. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Task definitions. 4. On the Task definitions page, choose the task, and then choose Create new revision.
69

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Deregistering a task definition revision using the new console
5. On the Create new task definition revision page, make changes. For example, to change the existing container definitions (such as the container image, memory limits, or port mappings), select the container, and then make the changes.
6. Verify the information, and then choose Create. 7. If your task definition is used in a service, update your service with the updated task definition. For
more information, see Updating a service (p. 237).
Deregistering a task definition revision using the new console
If you decide that you no longer need a specific task definition revision in Amazon ECS, you can deregister the task definition revision so that it no longer displays in your ListTaskDefinition API calls or in the console when you want to run a task or update a service.
When you deregister a task definition revision, it is immediately marked as INACTIVE. Existing tasks and services that reference an INACTIVE task definition revision continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an INACTIVE task definition revision can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count.
You can't use an INACTIVE task definition revision to run new tasks or create new services. You also can't update an existing service to reference an INACTIVE task definition revision (even though there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect).
Note At this time, INACTIVE task definition revisions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future. Therefore, you should not rely on INACTIVE task definition revisions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.
To deregister a new task definition (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. From the navigation bar, choose the region that contains your task definition. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Task definitions. 4. On the task definitions page, choose the task definition family that contains one or more revisions
that you want to deregister. 5. On the task definition Name page, choose the revision you want to deregister, such as "example-
task:1". 6. In the upper-right of the task definition revision detail page, choose Deregister. 7. Verify the information in the Deregister window, and then choose Deregister to finish.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Run a standalone task using the new console
scheduler. If your application is a one-time or periodic batch job, it doesn't make sense to keep running or restart when it finishes.
To deploy your application to run continually or to place it behind a load balancer, create an Amazon ECS service. For more information, see Amazon ECS services (p. 212).
To run a standalone task use one of the following procedures.
If you are creating a Windows service for the Fargate launch type, you must use the classic console.
To run a standalone task (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, select the cluster to run the standalone task in. 4. From the Tasks tab, choose Deploy. 5. The Compute configuration section can be expanded to change the compute option for your service
to use. By default, the console selects a compute option for you. Therefore, in most cases, you can proceed to the next step. The following describes the order that the console uses to select a default:
· If your cluster has a default capacity provider strategy that's defined, the default provider is selected.
· If your cluster doesn't have a default capacity provider strategy that's defined but you do have the Fargate capacity providers added to the cluster, a custom capacity provider strategy that uses the FARGATE capacity provider is selected.
· If your cluster doesn't have a default capacity provider strategy that's defined but you do have one or more Auto Scaling group capacity providers added to the cluster, the Use custom (Advanced) option is selected. You must manually define the strategy.
· If your cluster doesn't have a default capacity provider strategy that's defined and no capacity providers are added to the cluster, the Fargate launch type is selected.
6. For Application type, select Task. 7. For Task definition, choose the task definition family and revision to use.
Important The console validates that the selected task definition family and revision is compatible with the defined compute configuration. If you receive a warning, verify that both your task definition compatibility and the compute configuration are selected. 8. For Desired tasks, specify the number of tasks to launch. 9. The Networking section can be expanded to define the network configuration for the tasks. By default, the console selects the default Amazon VPC along with all subnets and the default security group within the default Amazon VPC. Use the following steps to specify a custom configuration.
a. For VPC, select the VPC to use. b. For Subnets, select one or more subnets in the VPC that the task scheduler is to use when
placing your tasks. c. For Security group, select an existing security group or create a new one. To use an existing
security group, select the security group and move to the next step. To create a new security group, choose Create a new security group. You must specify a security group name, description, and add one or more inbound rules for the security group. d. For Public IP, choose whether to auto-assign a public IP address to the elastic network interface (ENI) of the task. Tasks that are launched on AWS Fargate can be assigned a public IP address when they're run using a public subnet. This is so that they have a route to the internet. For more information, see Fargate task networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.

There are also help panels available for most of the sections in the console which provide further context.
To create a service (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. On the Clusters page, select the cluster to create the service in. 3. From the Services tab, choose Deploy. 4. The Compute configuration section can be expanded to change the compute option for your service
to use. By default, the console will select a compute option for you so in most cases you can go to the next step. The following describes the order that the console uses to select a default:
· If your cluster has a default capacity provider strategy defined, it will be selected. · If your cluster doesn't have a default capacity provider strategy defined but you do have the
Fargate capacity providers added to the cluster, a custom capacity provider strategy using the FARGATE capacity provider will be selected. · If your cluster doesn't have a default capacity provider strategy defined but you do have one or more Auto Scaling group capacity providers added to the cluster, the Use custom (Advanced) option is selected and you will need to manually define the strategy. · If your cluster doesn't have a default capacity provider strategy defined and no capacity providers added to the cluster, the Fargate launch type is selected. 5. For Application type, select Service. 6. For Task definition, choose the task definition family and revision to use.
Important The console validates that the selected task definition family and revision is compatible with the defined compute configuration. If you receive a warning, verify both your task definition compatibility and the compute configuration selected. 7. For Service name, specify a name for your service. 8. For Desired tasks, specify the number of tasks to launch and maintain in the service. 9. The Deployment options section can be expanded to change the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent of running tasks allowed during a service deployment. The console has default values for the most common use case selected.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Updating a service using the new console
Note Currently, only the Rolling update (ECS) deployment type is supported. To use any other deployment type, switch to the classic console. 10. (Optional) The Load balancing section can be expanded to configure a load balancer for your service. Use the following steps to configure your service to use an Application Load Balancer.
a. For Load balancer type, select Application Load Balancer. b. Choose Create a new load balancer to create a new Application Load Balancer or Use an
existing load balancer to select an existing Application Load Balancer. c. When creating a new load balancer, for Load balancer name, specify a unique name for your
load balancer. When using an existing load balancer, for Load balancer, select your existing load balancer. d. For Listener, specify a port and protocol for the Application Load Balancer to listen for connection requests on. By default, the load balancer will be configured to use port 80 and HTTP. e. For Target group name, specify a name and a protocol for the target group that the Application Load Balancer will route requests to. By default, the target group will route requests to the first container defined in your task definition. f. For Health check path, specify a path that exists within your container where the Application Load Balancer should periodically send requests to verify the connection health between the Application Load Balancer and the container. By default, a path of / is used which is the root directory. g. For Health check grace period, specify the amount of time (in seconds) that the service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks for. 11. The Networking section can be expanded to define the network configuration for the service. Task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode or services configured to use a load balancer must have a networking configuration. By default, the console selects the default Amazon VPC along with all subnets and the default security group within the default Amazon VPC. Use the following steps to specify a custom configuration.
a. For VPC, select the VPC to use. b. For Subnets, select one or more subnets in the VPC that the task scheduler should consider
when placing your tasks. c. For Security group, you can either select an existing security group or create a new one. To use
an existing security group, select the security group and move to the next step. To create a new security group, choose Create a new security group. You must specify a security group name, description, and then add one or more inbound rules for the security group. d. For Public IP, choose whether to auto-assign a public IP address to the elastic network interface (ENI) of the task. Tasks that are launched on AWS Fargate can be assigned a public IP address when run using a public subnet so they have a route to the internet. For more information, see Fargate task networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate. 12. (Optional) The Tags section can be expanded to add tags, in the form of key-value pairs, to the service.
Updating a service using the new console
You can update an Amazon ECS service using the new console. When updating a service using the AWS Management Console, the current service configuration is pre-populated. You are able to update the task definition, desired task count, capacity provider strategy, platform version, and deployment configuration; or any combination of these.
73

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Deleting a service using the new console
Note Currently, only services using the Rolling update (ECS) deployment type should be updated using the new console. To update a service using any other deployment type, switch to the old console. If you are changing the ports used by containers in a task definition, you may need to update the security groups for the container instances to work with the updated ports. If your service uses a load balancer, the load balancer configuration defined for your service when it was created cannot be changed. If you update the task definition for the service, the container name and container port that were specified when the service was created must remain in the task definition. To change the load balancer name, the container name, or the container port associated with a service load balancer configuration, you must create a new service. Amazon ECS does not automatically update the security groups associated with Elastic Load Balancing load balancers or Amazon ECS container instances.
To update a service (New Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the new console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2. 2. On the Clusters page, select the cluster. 3. On the Cluster overview page, check the box next to the service to update and choose Edit. 4. For Task definition, choose the task definition family and revision to use.
Important The console validates that the selected task definition family and revision is compatible with the defined compute configuration. If you receive a warning, verify both your task definition compatibility and the compute configuration selected. 5. Expand the Deployment options section and use the following steps to change the deployment configuration for your service.
a. For services on AWS Fargate the platform version can be updated. b. For services using a capacity provider strategy, the capacity provider strategy can be updated.
Note A service using an Auto Scaling group capacity provider can't be updated to use a Fargate capacity provider and vice versa. c. Select the Force new deployment option to have your service start a new deployment, which will stop all currently running tasks and launch new tasks using the updated configuration. d. For Min running tasks, specify the lower limit on the number of tasks in the service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). For more information, see Deployment configuration. e. For Max running tasks, specify the upper limit on the number of tasks in the service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). 6. Expand the Tags section to update the tags associated with the service. 7. Choose Update.
Deleting a service using the new console
You can delete an Amazon ECS service using the console. Before deletion, the service is automatically scaled down to zero. If you have a load balancer or service discovery resources associated with the service, they are not affected by the service deletion. To delete your Elastic Load Balancing resources, see one of the following topics, depending on your load balancer type: Delete an Application Load Balancer or Delete a Network Load Balancer. To delete your service discovery resources, follow the procedure below.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Cluster concepts
Amazon ECS clusters
An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services. Your tasks and services are run on infrastructure that is registered to a cluster. The infrastructure capacity can be provided by AWS Fargate, which is serverless infrastructure that AWS manages, Amazon EC2 instances that you manage, or an onpremise server or virtual machine (VM) that you manage remotely. In most cases, Amazon ECS capacity providers can be used to manage the infrastructure the tasks in your clusters use. For more information, see Amazon ECS capacity providers (p. 78).
When you first use Amazon ECS, a default cluster is created for you, but you can create multiple clusters in an account to keep your resources separate.
Topics · Cluster concepts (p. 76) · Creating a cluster using the classic console (p. 77) · Amazon ECS capacity providers (p. 78) · Updating cluster settings (p. 83) · Deleting a cluster using the classic console (p. 83) · Stopping tasks using the new console (p. 84)
Cluster concepts
The following are general concepts about Amazon ECS clusters.
· Clusters are Region-specific. · The following are the possible states that a cluster can be in.
ACTIVE
The cluster is ready to accept tasks and, if applicable, you can register container instances with the cluster. PROVISIONING
The cluster has capacity providers associated with it and the resources needed for the capacity provider are being created. DEPROVISIONING
The cluster has capacity providers associated with it and the resources needed for the capacity provider are being deleted. FAILED
The cluster has capacity providers associated with it and the resources needed for the capacity provider have failed to create. INACTIVE
The cluster has been deleted. Clusters with an INACTIVE status may remain discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE clusters persisting.
76

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a cluster using the classic console
· A cluster may contain a mix of tasks hosted on AWS Fargate, Amazon EC2 instances, or external instances. For more information about launch types, see Amazon ECS launch types (p. 124).
· A cluster may contain a mix of both Auto Scaling group capacity providers and Fargate capacity providers, however when specifying a capacity provider strategy they may only contain one or the other but not both. For more information, see Amazon ECS capacity providers (p. 78).
· Custom IAM policies may be created to allow or restrict user access to specific clusters. For more information, see the Cluster examples (p. 336) section in Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 331).
· Clusters with Fargate tasks can be scaled using Service Auto Scaling. For more information, see Service auto scaling (p. 263).
Creating a cluster using the classic console
You can create an Amazon ECS cluster using the classic AWS Management Console, as described in this topic. Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4).
The console cluster creation wizard provides a simple way to create the resources that are needed by an Amazon ECS cluster by creating a AWS CloudFormation stack. It also lets you customize several common cluster configuration options. However, the wizard does not allow you to customize every resource option. If your requirements extend beyond what is supported in this wizard, consider using our reference architecture at https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-refarch-cloudformation.
If you add or modify the underlying cluster resources directly after they are created by the wizard you may receive an error when attempting to delete the cluster. AWS CloudFormation refers to this as stack drift. For more information on detecting drift on an existing AWS CloudFormation stack, see Detect Drift on an Entire CloudFormation Stack in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
To create a cluster (AWS Management Console)
Before you begin, be sure that you create an IAM user, and then assign the appropriate IAM permissions. For more information, see the section called "Create an IAM user" (p. 4) and the section called "Cluster examples" (p. 336).
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, select the Region to use. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 4. On the Clusters page, choose Create Cluster. 5. For Select cluster compatibility, choose Networking only, then choose Next Step.
Important The FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers will be automatically associated with the cluster. For more information, see AWS Fargate capacity providers (p. 79). 6. On the Configure cluster page, enter a Cluster name. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. 7. In the Networking section, configure the VPC for your cluster. You can keep the default settings, or you can modify these settings with the following steps.
a. (Optional) If you choose to create a new VPC, for CIDR Block, select a CIDR block for your VPC. For more information, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
b. For Subnets, select the subnets to use for your VPC. You can keep the default settings or you can modify them to meet your needs.
8. In the CloudWatch Container Insights section, choose whether to turn on Container Insights for the cluster. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
9. Choose Create.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Capacity providers
Amazon ECS capacity providers
Amazon ECS capacity providers are used to manage the infrastructure the tasks in your clusters use. Each cluster can have one or more capacity providers and an optional default capacity provider strategy. The capacity provider strategy determines how the tasks are spread across the cluster's capacity providers. When you run a standalone task or create a service, you may either use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy or specify a capacity provider strategy that overrides the cluster's default strategy.
Capacity provider concepts
Capacity providers consist of the following components.
Capacity provider
A capacity provider is associated with a cluster and is used in a capacity provider strategy to determine the infrastructure that a task runs on.
For Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate users, there is a FARGATE and a FARGATE_SPOT capacity provider. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are reserved and don't need to be created nor can they be deleted. After you associate them with your cluster, you may add them to a capacity provider strategy. For more information, see AWS Fargate capacity providers (p. 79). Default capacity provider strategy
A default capacity provider strategy is associated with an Amazon ECS cluster. This determines the capacity provider strategy used creating a service or running a standalone task in the cluster when there isn't a custom capacity provider strategy or launch type specified. It is considered best practice to define a default capacity provider strategy for each cluster. Capacity provider strategy
A capacity provider strategy is specified when creating a service or running a standalone task when the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster does not meet your needs.
Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider can be associated with a cluster either during cluster creation or by using the PutClusterCapacityProviders API after a cluster has been created.
A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers. An optional base and weight value may be specified for finer control of a capacity provider.
The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.
The weight value designates the relative percentage of the total number of launched tasks that should use the specified capacity provider. For example, if you have a strategy that contains two capacity providers, and both have a weight of 1, then when the base is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capacityProviderB, then for every one task that is run using capacityProviderA, four tasks would use capacityProviderB.
Capacity provider types
The infrastructure your Amazon ECS workloads are run on determines the type of capacity provider you can use.
For Amazon ECS workloads hosted on Fargate, the following predefined capacity providers are available:
78

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Capacity provider considerations
· Fargate · Fargate Spot
For Amazon ECS workloads hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, you must create and maintain a capacity provider that consists of the following components:
· A name · An Auto Scaling group · The settings for managed scaling and managed termination protection.
Capacity provider considerations
The following should be considered when using capacity providers:
· A capacity provider must be associated with a cluster prior to being specified in a capacity provider strategy.
· When you specify a capacity provider strategy, the number of capacity providers that can be specified is limited to six.
· A service using an Auto Scaling group capacity provider can't be updated to use a Fargate capacity provider and vice versa.
· In a capacity provider strategy, if no weight value is specified for a capacity provider in the console then the default value of 1 is used. If using the API or AWS CLI, the default value of 0 is used.
· When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of 0 will not be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0, any RunTask or CreateService actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.
· In a capacity provider strategy, only one capacity provider can have a base value defined. If no base value is specified, the default value of 0 is used.
· A cluster may contain a mix of both Auto Scaling group capacity providers and Fargate capacity providers, however a capacity provider strategy may only contain one or the other but not both.
· A cluster may contain a mix of services and standalone tasks using both capacity providers and launch types. A service may be updated to use a capacity provider strategy rather than a launch type, however you must force a new deployment when doing so.
· When you use managed termination protection, you must also use managed scaling otherwise managed termination protection won't work.
· Using capacity providers is not supported when using Classic Load Balancers for your services.
AWS Fargate capacity providers
Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate capacity providers allow you to use both Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity with your Amazon ECS tasks. For more information about capacity providers, see Amazon ECS capacity providers (p. 78).
With Fargate Spot you can run interruption tolerant Amazon ECS tasks at a discounted rate compared to the Fargate price. Fargate Spot runs tasks on spare compute capacity. When AWS needs the capacity back, your tasks will be interrupted with a two-minute warning. This is described in further detail below.
Fargate capacity provider considerations
The following should be considered when using Fargate capacity providers.
79

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS Fargate capacity providers
· The Fargate Spot capacity provider is not supported for Windows containers on Fargate. · The Fargate Spot capacity provider is not supported for Linux tasks with the ARM64 architecture,
Fargate Spot only supports Linux tasks with the X86_64 architecture. · The Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers don't need to be created. They are available to all
accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be available for use. · To associate Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers to an existing cluster, you must use the
Amazon ECS API or AWS CLI. For more information, see Adding Fargate capacity providers to an existing cluster (p. 81). · The Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers are reserved and cannot be deleted. You can disassociate them from a cluster using the PutClusterCapacityProviders API. · When a new cluster is created using the Amazon ECS classic console along with the Networking only cluster template, the FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers are associated with the new cluster automatically. · Using Fargate Spot requires that your task use platform version 1.3.0 or later (for Linux). For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58). · When tasks using the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers are stopped, a task state change event is sent to Amazon EventBridge. The stopped reason describes the cause. For more information, see Task state change events (p. 299). · A cluster may contain a mix of Fargate and Auto Scaling group capacity providers, however a capacity provider strategy may only contain either Fargate or Auto Scaling group capacity providers, but not both. For more information, see Auto Scaling Group Capacity Providers in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Handling Fargate Spot termination notices
When tasks using Fargate Spot capacity are stopped due to a Spot interruption, a two-minute warning is sent before a task is stopped. The warning is sent as a task state change event to Amazon EventBridge and a SIGTERM signal to the running task. When using Fargate Spot as part of a service, the service scheduler will receive the interruption signal and attempt to launch additional tasks on Fargate Spot if capacity is available. A service with only one task will be interrupted until capacity is available.
To ensure that your containers exit gracefully before the task stops, the following can be configured:
· A stopTimeout value of 120 seconds or less can be specified in the container definition that the task is using. Specifying a stopTimeout value gives you time between the moment the task state change event is received and the point at which the container is forcefully stopped. If you don't specify a stopTimeout value, the default value of 30 seconds is used. For more information, see Container timeouts (p. 117).
· The SIGTERM signal must be received from within the container to perform any cleanup actions. Failure to process this signal will result in the task receiving a SIGKILL signal after the configured stopTimeout and may result in data loss or corruption.
The following is a snippet of a task state change event displaying the stopped reason and stop code for a Fargate Spot interruption.

Creating a new cluster that uses Fargate capacity providers
When a new Amazon ECS cluster is created, you can specify one or more capacity providers to associate with the cluster. The capacity providers are used to define a capacity provider strategy which determine the infrastructure your tasks run on.
When using the AWS Management Console, the FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers are associated with the cluster automatically when using the Networking only cluster template. For more information, see Creating a cluster using the classic console (p. 77).
To create an Amazon ECS cluster using Fargate capacity providers (AWS CLI)
Use the following command to create a new cluster and associate both the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers with it.
· create-cluster (AWS CLI)
aws ecs create-cluster \ --cluster-name FargateCluster \ --capacity-providers FARGATE FARGATE_SPOT \ --region us-west-2
Adding Fargate capacity providers to an existing cluster
You can update the pool of available capacity providers for an existing Amazon ECS cluster by using the PutClusterCapacityProviders API.
81

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS Fargate capacity providers
Adding either the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers to an existing cluster is not supported in the AWS Management Console. You must either create a new Fargate cluster in the console or add the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers to the existing cluster using the Amazon ECS API or AWS CLI.
To add the Fargate capacity providers to an existing cluster (AWS CLI)
Use the following command to add the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers to an existing cluster. If the specified cluster has existing capacity providers associated with it, you must specify all existing capacity providers in addition to any new ones you want to add. Any existing capacity providers associated with a cluster that are omitted from a PutClusterCapacityProviders API call will be disassociated from the cluster. You can only disassociate an existing capacity provider from a cluster if it's not being used by any existing tasks. These same rules apply to the cluster's default capacity provider strategy. If the cluster has an existing default capacity provider strategy defined, it must be included in the PutClusterCapacityProviders API call. Otherwise, it will be overwritten.

Running tasks using a Fargate capacity provider
You can run a task or create a service using either the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers by specifying a capacity provider strategy. If no capacity provider strategy is provided, the cluster's default capacity provider strategy is used.
Running a task using the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers is supported in the AWS Management Console. You must add the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers to cluster's default capacity provider strategy if using the AWS Management Console. When using the Amazon ECS API or AWS CLI you can specify either a capacity provider strategy or use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy.
To run a task using a Fargate capacity provider (AWS CLI)
Use the following command to run a task using the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers.
· run-task (AWS CLI)

Updating cluster settings
Cluster settings allow you to configure parameters for your existing Amazon ECS clusters. You can update cluster settings using the Amazon ECS API, AWS CLI or SDKs. Currently, the only supported cluster setting is containerInsights, which allows you to turn on or off CloudWatch Container Insights for an existing cluster. To turn on CloudWatch Container Insights for a new cluster, that can be done in the AWS Management Console during cluster creation. For more information, see Creating a cluster using the classic console (p. 77).
Important Currently, if you delete an existing cluster that does not have Container Insights enabled and then create a new cluster with the same name with Container Insights enabled, Container Insights will not actually be enabled. If you want to preserve the same name for your existing cluster and turn on Container Insights, you must wait 7 days before you can re-create it.
To update the settings for a cluster (AWS CLI)
Use one of the following commands to update the setting for a cluster.
· update-cluster-settings (AWS CLI)
aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster cluster_name_or_arn --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled|disabled --region us-east-1
Deleting a cluster using the classic console
If you are finished using a cluster, you can delete it. After you delete the cluster, it transitions to the INACTIVE state. Clusters with an INACTIVE status may remain discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE clusters persisting.
When you delete a cluster in the Amazon ECS console, the associated resources that are deleted with it vary depending on how the cluster was created. This condition is discussed in step 5 of the following procedure.
83

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Stopping tasks using the new console
If your cluster was created with the AWS Management Console then the AWS CloudFormation stack that was created for your cluster is also deleted when you delete your cluster. If you have added or modified the underlying cluster resources you may receive an error when attempting to delete the cluster. AWS CloudFormation refers to this as stack drift. For more information on detecting drift on an existing AWS CloudFormation stack, see Detect drift on an entire AWS CloudFormation stack in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. To delete a cluster using the classic console 1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, select the Region to use. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 4. On the Clusters page, select the cluster to delete. 5. In the upper-right of the page, choose Delete Cluster. You see a confirmation prompt. 6. In the confirmation box, enter delete me.
Stopping tasks using the new console
If you decide that you no longer need to keep a task running, you can use the new console to stop one or more tasks. To stop tasks using the new console 1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, choose the cluster. 4. On the Cluster : name page, choose the Tasks tab. 5. Perform one of the following operations:
· To stop one or more tasks, select the tasks, and then choose Stop, Stop selected. · To stop all tasks, choose Stop, Stop all. 6. On the Stop confirmation page, enter Stop, and then choose Stop.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Fargate task definition considerations
Amazon ECS task definitions
A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. The following are some of the parameters that you can specify in a task definition:
· The Docker image to use with each container in your task · How much CPU and memory to use with each task · The launch type to use, which determines the infrastructure that your tasks are hosted on · The operating system of the container that the task run on · The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in your task · The logging configuration to use for your tasks · Whether the task continues to run if the container finishes or fails · The command that the container runs when it's started · Any data volumes that are used with the containers in the task · The IAM role that your tasks use
Your entire application stack doesn't need to be on a single task definition, and in most cases it isn't on a single task definition. Your application can span multiple task definitions. You can do this by combining related containers into their own task definitions, each representing a single component. For more information, see Application architecture (p. 90).

Fargate task definition considerations
Tasks that use the Fargate launch type don't support all of the Amazon ECS task definition parameters that are available. Some parameters aren't supported at all, and others behave differently for Fargate tasks.
85

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Network mode
The following task definition parameters aren't valid in Fargate tasks:
· devices · disableNetworking · dnsSearchDomains · dnsServers · dockerSecurityOptions · dockerVolumeConfiguration · extraHosts · host · hostname · links · placementConstraints -- By default, Fargate tasks are spread across multiple Availability Zones. · privileged · sharedMemorySize · tmpfs
Important If one of the task definition parameters isn't supported, the subflags for that parameter likely aren't supported either.
The following task definition parameters behave differently for Fargate tasks:
· When using logConfiguration, the supported log drivers for Fargate tasks are the awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens log drivers.
Windows tasks don't support awsfirelens log drivers. · When using linuxParameters for capabilities, the drop parameter can be used, but the add
parameter isn't supported. · The healthCheck parameter is supported only for Fargate tasks that use the platform version 1.1.0
or later. · If you use the portMappings parameter, specify containerPort only. You can either keep
hostPort blank or set it to the same value as containerPort. · The operatingSystemFamily parameter is required for tasks that run on Linux containers and
Windows containers.
To ensure that your task definition validates for use with the Fargate launch type, you can specify the following when you register the task definition:
· In the AWS Management Console, for the Requires Compatibilities field, specify FARGATE. · In the AWS CLI, for the --requires-compatibilities option, specify FARGATE. · In the API, specify the requiresCompatibilities flag.
Network mode
Fargate task definitions require that the network mode is set to awsvpc. The awsvpc network mode provides each task with its own elastic network interface. A network configuration is also required when creating a service or manually running tasks. For more information, see Fargate Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task CPU and memory

Task CPU and memory
For Fargate task definitions, you're required to specify CPU and memory at the task level. You can also specify CPU and memory at the container level for Fargate tasks. However, doing so isn't required. For most use cases, it's OK to specify these resources at the task level only. The following table shows the valid combinations of task-level CPU and memory.

CPU value 256 (.25 vCPU) 512 (0.5 vCPU) 1024 (1 vCPU) 2048 (2 vCPU) 4096 (4 vCPU)

Memory value 0.5 GB, 1 GB, 2 GB 1 GB, 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB, 5 GB, 6 GB, 7 GB, 8 GB Between 4 GB and 16 GB in 1-GB increments Between 8 GB and 30 GB in 1-GB increments

Logging
Fargate task definitions support the awslogs, splunk and awsfirelens log drivers only for the log configuration. The following code shows a snippet of a task definition where the awslogs log driver is configured:
"logConfiguration": { "logDriver": "awslogs", "options": { "awslogs-group" : "/ecs/fargate-task-definition", "awslogs-region": "us-east-1", "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
}
For more information about how you can use the awslogs log driver in task definitions to send your container logs to CloudWatch Logs, see Using the awslogs log driver (p. 138).
For more information about using the awsfirelens log driver in a task definition, see Custom log routing (p. 144).
Amazon ECS Task execution IAM role
You can specify an optional task execution IAM role with Fargate to allow your Fargate tasks to make API calls to Amazon ECR. The API calls pull container images. They also call CloudWatch to store container application logs. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Example task definition
The following is an example task definition that uses the Linux containers on Fargate launch type to set up a web server:
{ "containerDefinitions": [ {

Task storage
For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the following storage types are supported:
· Amazon EFS volumes for persistent storage. For more information, see Amazon EFS volumes (p. 129).
· Ephemeral storage for nonpersistent storage.
When provisioned, each Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate receives the following ephemeral storage. The ephemeral storage configuration depends on which platform version the task is using. After a Fargate task stops, the ephemeral storage is deleted. For more information about Amazon ECS default service limits, see Amazon ECS service quotas (p. 281).
Note The host and sourcePath parameters are not supported for Fargate tasks.
88

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task storage
Fargate Linux platform versions
Fargate tasks using platform version 1.4.0 or later
All Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks using platform version 1.4.0 or later receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage. Both the pulled, compressed, and the uncompressed container image for the task is stored on the ephemeral storage. To determine the total amount of ephemeral storage your task has to use, you must subtract the amount of storage your container image uses from the total amount.
For tasks using platform version 1.4.0 or later that are launched on May 28, 2020 or later, the ephemeral storage is encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm using an AWS Fargate-managed encryption key.
Fargate tasks using platform version 1.3.0 or earlier
For Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks using platform version 1.3.0 or earlier, each task receives the following ephemeral storage.
· 10 GB of Docker layer storage Note This amount includes both compressed and uncompressed container image artifacts.
· An additional 4 GB for volume mounts. This can be mounted and shared among containers using the volumes, mountPoints and volumesFrom parameters in the task definition.
Fargate Windows platform versions
Fargate tasks using platform version 1.0.0 or later
All Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks using platform version 1.0.0 or later receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage. Both the pulled, compressed, and the uncompressed container image for the task is stored on the ephemeral storage. To determine the total amount of ephemeral storage your task has to use, you must subtract the amount of storage your container image uses from the total amount.
The ephemeral storage is encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm using an AWS Fargatemanaged encryption key.
Example task definition
In this example, you have two application containers that need to access the same scratch file storage location.
To provide nonpersistent empty storage for containers in a Fargate task
1. In the task definition volumes section, define a volume with the name application_scratch.
"volumes": [ { "name": "application_scratch", "host": {} }
]
2. In the containerDefinitions section, create the application container definitions so they mount the nonpersistent storage.

Application architecture
You can follow one of the two following models to run your containers:
· Fargate launch type - This is a serverless pay-as-you-go option. You can run containers without having to manage your infrastructure.
· EC2 launch type - Configure and deploy EC2 instances in your cluster to run your containers.
How you architect your application on Amazon ECS depends on several factors, with the launch type that you're using being a key differentiator. We give the following guidance which should assist in the process.
Using the Fargate launch type
The Fargate launch type is suitable for the following workloads:
· Large workloads that require low operational overhead · Small workloads that have occasional burst · Tiny workloads · Batch workloads
When architecting your application to run on Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate, you must decide between deploying multiple containers into the same task definition and deploying containers separately in multiple task definitions.
If the following conditions are required, we recommend deploying multiple containers into the same task definition:
· Your containers share a common lifecycle (that is, they're launched and terminated together).
90

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a task definition using the classic console
· Your containers must run on the same underlying host (that is, one container references the other on a localhost port).
· You require that your containers share resources. · Your containers share data volumes.
If these conditions aren't required, we recommend deploying containers separately in multiple task definitions. This is because, by doing so, you can scale, provision, and deprovision them separately.

Creating a task definition using the classic console
Important Amazon ECS has provided a new console experience for creating task definitions. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66).
Before running Docker containers on Amazon ECS, you must first create a task definition. When you create a task definition, you can use it to define multiple containers and data volumes. For more information about the available parameters for task definitions, see Task definition parameters (p. 97).
To create a new task definition (classic Amazon ECS console)
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose task definitions, Create new task definition. 3. On the Select launch type compatibilities page, choose FARGATE and then Next step. 4. (Optional) If you have a JSON representation of your task definition, complete the following steps:
a. On the Configure task and container definitions page, scroll to the bottom of the page and choose Configure via JSON.
b. Paste your task definition JSON into the text area and choose Save. c. Verify your information and choose Create.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose Configure via JSON. 5. For Task Definition Name, type a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and
lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. 6. For Operating system family, choose the container operating system. 7. For Task execution IAM role, either select your task execution role or choose Create new role so
that the console can create one for you. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354). 8. For Task size, choose a value for Task memory (GB) and Task CPU (vCPU). The table below shows the valid combinations.

9. For each container in your task definition, complete the following steps:

a. Choose Add container.
b. Fill out each required field and any optional fields to use in your container definitions. More container definition parameters are available in the Advanced container configuration menu. For more information, see Task definition parameters (p. 97).
c. Choose Add to add your container to the task definition.
10. (Optional) For Service Integration, to configure the parameters for App Mesh integration, choose Enable App Mesh integration and then do the following:

a. For Mesh name, choose the existing App Mesh service mesh to use. If you don't see any meshes listed, then you need to create one first. For more information, see Service meshes in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.
Note This option is not available for Windows containers on Fargate.
b. For App Mesh endpoints, select one of the following options.

· Virtual node ­ Enter or select the following information.
· For Application container name, choose the container name to use for the App Mesh integration. This container must already be defined within the task definition.
· For Virtual node name, choose the existing App Mesh virtual node to use. If you don't see any virtual nodes listed, then you need to create one first. For more information, see Virtual nodes in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.
· For Virtual node port ­ Pre-populated with the listener port set on the virtual node in App Mesh.
· Virtual gateway ­ Enter or select the following information.
· For Virtual gateway name, choose the existing App Mesh virtual gateway to use. If you don't see any virtual gateways listed, then you need to create one first. For more information, see Virtual gateways in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.
· For Virtual gateway port ­ Pre-populated with the listener port set on the virtual gateway in App Mesh.
c. For Envoy image, enter 840364872350.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-appmeshenvoy:v1.15.1.0-prod for all regions except me-south-1 and ap-east-1. You can replace uswest-2 with any Region except me-south-1 and ap-east-1. If your application is in one of these regions, then you also need to replace 840364872350 with the appropriate value for your Region. For more information, see Envoy image in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.
d. Choose Apply and then choose Confirm. This will add an Envoy proxy container to the task definition, as well as the settings to support it. If you selected Virtual node, it will also autopopulate the App Mesh Proxy Configuration settings for the next step. If you selected Virtual gateway, then the Proxy Configuration is disabled, because it's not used for a virtual gateway.
11. (Optional) If you selected Virtual node in Service Integration, then for Proxy Configuration, verify all of the pre-populated values. For more information about these fields, see the JSON tab in Update services.
12. (Optional) For Log Router Integration, you can add a custom log routing configuration. Choose Enable FireLens integration and then do the following:

92

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task definition template
Note This option is not available for Windows containers on Fargate.
a. For Type, choose the log router type to use. b. For Image, type the image URI for your log router container. If you chose the fluentbit
log router type, the Image field pre-populates with the AWS for Fluent Bit image. For more information, see Using the AWS for Fluent Bit image (p. 148). c. Choose Apply. This creates a new log router container to the task definition named log_router, and applies the settings to support it. If you make changes to the log router integration fields, choose Apply again to update the FireLens container. 13. (Optional) To define data volumes for your task, choose Add volume. For more information, see Using data volumes in tasks (p. 127).
· For Name, type a name for your volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
14. In the Tags section, specify the key and value for each tag to associate with the task definition. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources.
15. Choose Create.
To create a new task definition (AWS CLI)
· Use the register-task-definition command. For more information, see register-taskdefinition in the AWS Command Line Interface Reference.
Task definition template
An empty task definition template is shown as follows. You can use this template to create your task definition, which can then be pasted into the console JSON input area or saved to a file and used with the AWS CLI --cli-input-json option.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task definition parameters
You can generate this task definition template using the following AWS CLI command.
aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton
Task definition parameters
Task definitions are split into separate parts: the task family, the IAM task role, the network mode, container definitions, volumes, task placement constraints, and launch types. The family and container definitions are required in a task definition. In contrast, task role, network mode, volumes, task placement constraints, and launch type are optional. You can use these parameters in a JSON file to configure your task definition. For more information, see the section called "Example task definitions" (p. 169). The following are more detailed descriptions for each task definition parameter.
Family
family Type: string Required: yes When you register a task definition, you give it a family, which is similar to a name for multiple versions of the task definition, specified with a revision number. The first task definition that's registered into a particular family is given a revision of 1, and any task definitions registered after that are given a sequential revision number.
Launch types
When you register a task definition, you can specify a launch type that Amazon ECS should validate the task definition against.If the task definition doesn't validate against the compatibilities specified, a client exception is returned. For more information, see Amazon ECS launch types (p. 124). The following parameter is allowed in a task definition. requiresCompatibilities
Type: string array Required: no Valid Values: EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL The launch type to validate the task definition against. This enables a check to ensure that all of the parameters that are used in the task definition meet the requirements of the launch type.
Task execution role
executionRoleArn Type: string Required: no
97

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Network mode
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The task execution IAM role is required depending on the requirements of your task. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Network mode
networkMode Type: string
Required: no
The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. For Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate, the awsvpc network mode is required. When the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Fargate Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.
The awsvpc network mode offers the highest networking performance for containers because they use the Amazon EC2 network stack. Exposed container ports are mapped directly to the attached elastic network interface port. Because of this, you can't use dynamic host port mappings.
Runtime platform
The following parameters are required for Fargate launch types.
operatingSystemFamily Type: string
Required: Conditional
Default: LINUX
This parameter is required for Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate.
When you register a task definition, you specify the operating system family.
The valid values for Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate are LINUX, WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL, and WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE. The valid values for Amazon ECS tasks hosted on EC2 are LINUX, WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_CORE, WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL, WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL, and WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE, WINDOWS_SERVER_2016_FULL, WINDOWS_SERVER_2004_CORE, and WINDOWS_SERVER_20H2_CORE. All task definitions that are used in a service must have the same value for this parameter.
When a task definition is part of a service, this value must match the service platformFamily value. cpuArchitecture Type: string
Required: Conditional
98

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task size

Default: X86_64
This parameter is required for Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate.
When you register a task definition, you specify the CPU architecture. The valid values are X86_64 and ARM64.
All task definitions that are used in a service must have the same value for this parameter.
When you have Linux tasks for either the Fargate launch type, or the EC2 launch type, you can set the value to ARM64. For more information, see the section called "Working with 64-bit ARM workloads on Amazon ECS" (p. 125).

Task size
When you register a task definition, you can specify the total CPU and memory used for the task. This is separate from the cpu and memory values at the container definition level. For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, these fields are optional. For tasks that are hosted on Fargate (both Linux and Windows), these fields are required and there are specific values for both cpu and memory that are supported.
Note Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers.
The following parameter is allowed in a task definition:
cpu
Type: string
Required: conditional Note This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
The hard limit of CPU units to present for the task. It can be expressed as an integer using CPU units (for example, 1024) or as a string using vCPUs (for example, 1 vCPU or 1 vcpu) in a task definition. When the task definition is registered, a vCPU value is converted to an integer indicating the CPU units.
For tasks that are hosted on Fargate (both Linux and Windows containers), this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of supported values for the memory parameter:

Name
name
Type: string
Required: yes
The name of a container. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. If you're linking multiple containers in a task definition, the name of one container can be entered in the links of another container. This is to connect the containers.
Image
image
Type: string
Required: yes
The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. You can also specify other repositories with either repository-url/image:tag or repository-url/image@digest. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of docker run. · When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified
image and tag for the container to use. However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks. · Images in private registries are supported. For more information, see Private registry authentication for tasks (p. 174). · Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by using either the full registry/ repository:tag or registry/repository@digest naming convention (for example, aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-webapp:latest or aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-webapp@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE). · Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ubuntu or mongo). · Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent). · Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu).
Memory
memory
Type: integer
Required: conditional
The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for
101

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
all containers within a task must be lower than the task memory value, if one is specified. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the -memory option to docker run.
If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional.
The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 6 MiB of memory for your containers.
The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 4 MiB of memory for your containers. memoryReservation
Type: integer
Required: no
The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when needed, up to either the hard limit that's specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to MemoryReservation in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory-reservation option to docker run.
If a task-level memory value isn't specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in a container definition. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used.
For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration allows the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance. At the same time, it also allows the container to use more memory resources when needed.
Note This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 6 MiB of memory for your containers.
The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.
Port mappings
portMappings
Type: object array
Required: no
Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic.
For task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode, only specify the containerPort. The hostPort can be left blank or it must be the same value as the containerPort.
102

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
This parameter maps to PortBindings in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to host, host ports must either be undefined or match the container port in the port mapping.
Note After a task reaches the RUNNING status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the following locations: · Console: The Network Bindings section of a container description for a selected task. · AWS CLI: The networkBindings section of the describe-tasks command output. · API: The DescribeTasks response. containerPort
Type: integer
Required: yes, when portMappings are used
The port number on the container that's bound to the user-specified or automatically assigned host port.
If using containers in a task with the Fargate launch type, exposed ports must be specified using containerPort.
For Windows containers on Fargate, you can't use port 3150 for the containerPort. This is because it's reserved.
If using containers in a task with the EC2 launch type and you specify a container port and not a host port, your container automatically receives a host port in the ephemeral port range. For more information, see hostPort. Port mappings that are automatically assigned in this way don't count toward the 100 reserved ports limit of a container instance. hostPort
Type: integer
Required: no
The port number on the container instance to reserve for your container.
If using containers in a task with the Fargate launch type, the hostPort can either be kept blank or be the same value as containerPort.
If using containers in a task with the EC2 launch type, you can specify a non-reserved host port for your container port mapping (this is referred to as static host port mapping), or you can omit the hostPort (or set it to 0) while specifying a containerPort and your container automatically receives a port (this is referred to as dynamic host port mapping) in the ephemeral port range for your container instance operating system and Docker version.
The default ephemeral port range Docker version 1.6.0 and later is listed on the instance under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range. If this kernel parameter is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range from 49153­65535 is used. Don't attempt to specify a host port in the ephemeral port range. This is because these are reserved for automatic assignment. In general, ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port range.
The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and 2376, and the Amazon ECS container agent ports 51678-51680. Any host port that was previously user-specified for a running task is also reserved while the task is running (after a task stops, the host port is released). The current reserved ports are displayed in the remainingResources of describecontainer-instances output, and a container instance might have up to 100 reserved ports at a time, including the default reserved ports. Automatically assigned ports do not count toward the 100 reserved ports limit.
103

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
protocol
Type: string
Required: no
The protocol that's used for the port mapping. Valid values are tcp and udp. The default is tcp.
If you're specifying a host port, use the following syntax.
"portMappings": [ { "containerPort": integer, "hostPort": integer } ...
]
If you want an automatically assigned host port, use the following syntax.
"portMappings": [ { "containerPort": integer } ...

Advanced container definition parameters
The following advanced container definition parameters provide extended capabilities to the docker run command that's used to launch containers on your Amazon ECS container instances.
Topics · Health check (p. 104) · Environment (p. 106) · Network settings (p. 109) · Storage and logging (p. 109) · Security (p. 113) · Resource limits (p. 113) · Docker labels (p. 114)
Health check
healthCheck
The container health check command and the associated configuration parameters for the container. This parameter maps to HealthCheck in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the HEALTHCHECK parameter of docker run.
Note The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks that are specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS doesn't monitor Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image but aren't specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.
104

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.
The following describes the possible healthStatus values for a container: · HEALTHY--The container health check has passed successfully. · UNHEALTHY--The container health check has failed. · UNKNOWN--The container health check is being evaluated or there's no container health check
defined.
The following describes the possible healthStatus values for a task. The container health check status of non-essential containers don't have an effect on the health status of a task. · HEALTHY--All essential containers within the task have passed their health checks. · UNHEALTHY--One or more essential containers have failed their health check. · UNKNOWN--The essential containers within the task are still having their health checks evaluated
or there are no container health checks defined.
If a task is run manually and not as part of a service, it continues its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy, then the task is stopped and the service scheduler replaces it.
The following are notes about container health check support: · Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using Linux platform version
1.1.0 or later. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58). · Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of a service that is configured to
use a Classic Load Balancer. command
A string array representing the command that the container runs to determine if it's healthy. The string array can start with CMD to run the command arguments directly, or CMD-SHELL to run the command with the container's default shell. If neither is specified, CMD is used.
When registering a task definition in the AWS Management Console, use a comma separated list of commands, which are converted to a string after the task definition is created. An example input for a health check is the following.
CMD-SHELL, curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
When registering a task definition using the AWS Management Console JSON panel, the AWS CLI, or the APIs, you should enclose the list of commands in brackets. An example input for a health check is the following.
[ "CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1" ]
An exit code of 0, with no stderr output, indicates success, and a non-zero exit code indicates failure. For more information, see HealthCheck in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API. interval
The period of time (in seconds) between each health check execution. You may specify between 5 and 300 seconds. The default value is 30 seconds. timeout
The period of time (in seconds) to wait for a health check to succeed before it's considered a failure. You may specify between 2 and 60 seconds. The default value is 5 seconds.
105

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
retries
The number of times to retry a failed health check before the container is considered unhealthy. You may specify between 1 and 10 retries. The default value is three retries. startPeriod
The optional grace period to provide containers time to bootstrap in before failed health checks count towards the maximum number of retries. You can specify between 0 and 300 seconds. By default, startPeriod is disabled.
Environment
cpu
Type: integer
Required: conditional
The number of cpu units the Amazon ECS container agent reserves for the container. On Linux, this parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run.
This field is optional for tasks that use the Fargate launch type. The total amount of CPU reserved for all the containers that are within a task must be lower than the task-level cpu value.
Note You can determine the number of CPU units that are available to each Amazon EC2 instance type by multiplying the number of vCPUs listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances detail page by 1,024.
Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, assume that you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that task is the only task running on the container instance. In this example, the container can use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, assume then that you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance. Each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container can float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. However, if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they are limited to 512 CPU units.
On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see CPU share constraint in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below two in your container definitions. For CPU values below two (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version: · Agent versions <= 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then
converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of one are passed to Docker as one, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares. · Agent versions >= 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of one are passed to Docker as two CPU shares.
On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's defined in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as 0, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.
For additional examples, see How Amazon ECS manages CPU and memory resources. essential
Type: Boolean
106

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
Required: no
If the essential parameter of a container is marked as true, and that container fails or stops for any reason, all other containers that are part of the task are stopped. If the essential parameter of a container is marked as false, then its failure doesn't affect the rest of the containers in a task. If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential.
All tasks must have at least one essential container. If you have an application that's composed of multiple containers, group containers that are used for a common purpose into components, and separate the different components into multiple task definitions. For more information, see Application architecture (p. 90).

Required: no
The log configuration specification for the container.
For example task definitions that use a log configuration, see Example task definitions (p. 189).
110

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
This parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --log-driver option to docker run. By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information about the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.
Consider the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers: · Amazon ECS supports a subset of the logging drivers that are available to the Docker daemon
(shown in the valid values that follow). Additional log drivers might be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. · This parameter requires version 1.18 or later of the Docker Remote API on your container instance. · For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, because you don't have access to the underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs to.

Required: yes, when logConfiguration is used
The log driver to use for the container. By default, the valid values that are listed earlier are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with.
For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens.
For more information about how to use the awslogs log driver in task definitions to send your container logs to CloudWatch Logs, see Using the awslogs log driver (p. 138).
For more information about using the awsfirelens log driver, see Custom Log Routing.
This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. options
Type: string to string map
Required: no
The configuration options to send to the log driver.
111

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
When you use FireLens to route logs to an AWS service or AWS Partner Network (APN) destination for log storage and analytics, you can set the log-driver-buffer-limit option to limit the number of events that are buffered in memory, before being sent to the log router container. It can help to resolve potential log loss issue because high throughput might result in memory running out for the buffer inside of Docker. For more information, see the section called "Fluentd buffer limit" (p. 146).
This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. secretOptions

Container dependency
dependsOn
Type: Array of ContainerDependency objects
Required: no
The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for container startup, for container shutdown it is reversed. For an example, see Example: Container dependency (p. 192).
Note If a container doesn't meet a dependency constraint or times out before meeting the constraint, Amazon ECS doesn't progress dependent containers to their next state.
For Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate, this parameter requires that the task or service uses platform version 1.3.0 or later (Linux) or 1.0.0 (Windows).

containerName
Type: String
Required: Yes
The container name that must meet the specified condition. condition
Type: String
Required: Yes
The dependency condition of the container. The following are the available conditions and their behavior: · START ­ This condition emulates the behavior of links and volumes today. It validates that a
dependent container is started before permitting other containers to start. · COMPLETE ­ This condition validates that a dependent container runs to completion (exits)
before permitting other containers to start. This can be useful for non-essential containers that run a script and then exit. This condition can't be set on an essential container. · SUCCESS ­ This condition is the same as COMPLETE, but it also requires that the container exits with a zero status. This condition can't be set on an essential container. · HEALTHY ­ This condition validates that the dependent container passes its Docker healthcheck before permitting other containers to start. This requires that the dependent container has health checks configured. This condition is confirmed only at task startup.
Container timeouts
startTimeout

For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a COMPLETE, SUCCESS, or HEALTHY status. If a startTimeout value is specified for containerB and it doesn't reach the desired status within that time, then containerA doesn't start.
Note If a container doesn't meet a dependency constraint or times out before meeting the constraint, Amazon ECS doesn't progress dependent containers to their next state.
For Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate, this parameter requires that the task or service uses platform version 1.3.0 or later (Linux). stopTimeout
Type: Integer
117

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Container definitions
Required: no
Example values: 120
Time duration (in seconds) to wait before the container is forcefully killed if it doesn't exit normally on its own.
For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires platform version 1.3.0 or later (Linux) or 1.0.0 or later (for Windows). The max stop timeout value is 120 seconds. However, if the parameter isn't specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used.
System controls
systemControls
Type: SystemControl object
Required: no
A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter maps to Sysctls in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --sysctl option to docker run.
We do not recommend that you specify network-related systemControls parameters for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the awsvpc or host network mode for the following reasons: · For tasks that use the awsvpc network mode, if you set systemControls for any container, it
applies to all containers in the task. If you set different systemControls for multiple containers in a single task, the container that's started last determines which systemControls take effect. · For tasks that use the host network mode, the network namespace systemControls aren't supported.
If you're setting an IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task, the following conditions apply to your system controls. For more information, see IPC mode (p. 123). · For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace systemControls aren't supported. · For tasks that use the task IPC mode, IPC namespace systemControls values applies to all
containers within a task. Note This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type.

value Type: string Required: no The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
Other task definition parameters
The following task definition parameters can be used when registering task definitions in the Amazon ECS console by using the Configure via JSON option. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66). Topics
· Ephemeral storage (p. 123) · IPC mode (p. 123) · PID mode (p. 124)
Ephemeral storage
ephemeralStorage Type: Object Required: No The amount of ephemeral storage (in GB) to allocate for the task. This parameter is used to expand the total amount of ephemeral storage available, beyond the default amount, for tasks that are hosted on AWS Fargate. For more information, see the section called "Bind mounts" (p. 132). Note This parameter is only supported for tasks that are hosted on AWS Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux). This isn't supported for Windows containers on Fargate.
IPC mode
ipcMode Type: String Required: No The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are host, task, or none. If host is specified, then all the containers that are within the tasks that specified the host

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Launch types
IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all the containers that are within the specified task share the same IPC resources. If none is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the value for ipcMode is set to shareable. For more information, see IPC settings in the Docker run reference.
If the host IPC mode is used, there's a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace exposure. For more information, see Docker security.
If you're setting namespaced kernel parameters that use systemControls for the containers in the task, the following applies to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see System controls (p. 118). · For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace that's related systemControls aren't
supported. · For tasks that use the task IPC mode, systemControls that relate to the IPC namespace apply
to all containers within a task.
Note This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type.
PID mode
pidMode
Type: String
Required: No
The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are host or task.

Working with 64-bit ARM workloads on Amazon ECS
Amazon ECS supports using 64-bit ARM applications. You can run your applications on the platform that's powered by AWS Graviton2 processors,. It's suitable for a wide variety of workloads. This includes
125

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Considerations
workloads such as application servers, micro-services, high-performance computing, CPU-based machine learning inference, video encoding, electronic design automation, gaming, open-source databases, and in-memory caches.
Considerations
Before you begin deploying task definitions that use the 64-bit ARM architecture, consider the following:
· The applications can use the Fargate or EC2 launch types. · The applications can only use the Linux operating system. · For the Fargate type, the applications must use Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or later . · The applications can use Fluent Bit or CloudWatch for monitoring. · For the Fargate launch type, the following AWS Regions do not support 64-bit ARM workloads:
· US East (N. Virginia) , the use1-az3 Availability Zone · China (Beijing) · China (Ningxia) · Africa (Cape Town) · Middle East (Bahrain) · AWS GovCloud (US-East) · AWS GovCloud (US-West) · In Asia Pacific (Osaka), specifically the apne3-az2 and apne3-az3 Availability Zones only · For the Amazon EC2 launch type, see the following to verify that the Region that you're in supports the instance type you want to use: · Amazon EC2 M6g Instances · Amazon EC2 T4g Instances · Amazon EC2 C6g Instances · Amazon EC2 R6gd Instances · Amazon EC2 X2gd Instances
You can also use the Amazon EC2 describe-instance-type-offerings command with a filter to view the instance offering for your Region.
aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --filters Name=instance-type,Values=instancetype --region region
The following example checks for the M6 instance type availability in the US East (N. Virginia) (useast-1) Region.
aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --filters Name=instance-type,Values=M6 --region us-east-1
For more information, see describe-instance-type-offerings in the Amazon EC2 Command Line Reference.
Specifying the ARM architecture in your task definition
To use the ARM architecture, specify ARM64 fo1r26the cpuArchitecture task definition parameter.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Interfaces for configuring ARM
In the following example, the ARM architecture is specified in a task definition. It's in JSON format.
{ "runtimePlatform": { "operatingSystemFamily": "LINUX", "cpuArchitecture": "ARM64" },

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Fargate task storage
Fargate task storage
When provisioned, each Amazon ECS task hosted on Linux containers on AWS Fargate receives the following ephemeral storage for bind mounts. This can be mounted and shared among containers that use the volumes, mountPoints, and volumesFrom parameters in the task definition. This isn't supported for Windows containers on AWS Fargate.
Fargate Linux container platform versions
Fargate tasks using platform version 1.4.0 or later
By default, Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage. The total amount of ephemeral storage can be increased, up to a maximum of 200 GiB. You can do this by specifying the ephemeralStorage parameter in your task definition.
The pulled, compressed, and the uncompressed container image for the task is stored on the ephemeral storage. To determine the total amount of ephemeral storage your task has to use, you must subtract the amount of storage your container image uses from the total amount of ephemeral storage your task is allocated.
For tasks that use platform version 1.4.0 or later that are launched on May 28, 2020 or later, the ephemeral storage is encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm. This algorithm uses an AWS owned encryption key.
Fargate tasks using platform version 1.3.0 or earlier
For Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks that use platform version 1.3.0 or earlier, each task receives the following ephemeral storage.
· 10 GB of Docker layer storage Note This amount includes both compressed and uncompressed container image artifacts.
· An additional 4 GB for volume mounts. This can be mounted and shared among containers that use the volumes, mountPoints, and volumesFrom parameters in the task definition.
Fargate Windows container platform versions
Fargate tasks using platform version 1.0.0 or later
By default, Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate using platform version 1.0.0 or later receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage.
The pulled, compressed, and the uncompressed container image for the task is stored on the ephemeral storage. To determine the total amount of ephemeral storage your task has to use, you must subtract the amount of storage your container image uses from the total amount of ephemeral storage your task is allocated.
The ephemeral storage is encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm, which uses an AWS owned encryption key.

· Amazon EFS volumes (p. 129) · Bind mounts (p. 132)
Amazon EFS volumes
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic. It grows and shrinks automatically as you add and remove files. Your applications can have the storage they need and when they need it.
You can use Amazon EFS file systems with Amazon ECS to export file system data across your fleet of container instances. That way, your tasks have access to the same persistent storage, no matter the instance on which they land. Your task definitions must reference volume mounts on the container instance to use the file system. The following sections describe how to get started using Amazon EFS with Amazon ECS.
Amazon EFS volume considerations
Consider the following when using Amazon EFS volumes:
· For tasks that are hosted on Fargate, Amazon EFS file systems are supported on platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux). For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
· When using Amazon EFS volumes for tasks that are hosted on Fargate, Fargate creates a supervisor container that's responsible for managing the Amazon EFS volume. The supervisor container uses a small amount of the task's memory. The supervisor container is visible when querying the task metadata version 4 endpoint. However, it isn't visible in CloudWatch Container Insights. For more information, see Task metadata endpoint version 4 (p. 380).
· Using Amazon EFS volumes or specifying an EFSVolumeConfiguration isn't supported on external instances.
Using Amazon EFS access points
Amazon EFS access points are application-specific entry points into an EFS file system for managing application access to shared datasets. For more information about Amazon EFS access points and how to control access to them, see Working with Amazon EFS Access Points in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide.
Access points can enforce a user identity, including the user's POSIX groups, for all file system requests that are made through the access point. Access points can also enforce a different root directory for the file system. This is so that clients can only access data in the specified directory or its subdirectories.
Note When creating an EFS access point, specify a path on the file system to serve as the root directory. When referencing the EFS file system with an access point ID in your Amazon ECS task definition, the root directory must either be omitted or set to /, which enforces the path set on the EFS access point.
You can use an Amazon ECS task IAM role to enforce that specific applications use a specific access point. By combining IAM policies with access points, you canprovide secure access to specific datasets for your applications. For more information about how to use task IAM roles, see IAM roles for tasks (p. 360).
Specifying an Amazon EFS file system in your task definition
To use Amazon EFS file system volumes for your containers, you must specify the volume and mount point configurations in your task definition. The following task definition JSON snippet shows the syntax for the volumes and mountPoints objects for a container.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Bind mounts
Bind mounts
With bind mounts, a file or directory on a host, such as AWS Fargate, is mounted into a container. Bind mounts are tied to the lifecycle of the container that uses them. After all of the containers that use a bind mount are stopped, such as when a task is stopped, the data is removed. For more information, see Using bind mounts in the Docker documentation.
The following are common use cases for bind mounts.
· To provide an empty data volume to mount in one or more containers. · To expose a path and its contents from a Dockerfile to one or more containers.
Considerations when using bind mounts
When using bind mounts, consider the following.
· For tasks that are hosted on AWS Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux) or 1.0.0 or later (Windows), by default they receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage for bind mounts. The total amount of ephemeral storage can be increased to a maximum of 200 GiB by specifying the ephemeralStorage object in your task definition.
· To expose files from a Dockerfile to a data volume when a task is run, the Amazon ECS data plane looks for a VOLUME directive. If the absolute path that's specified in the VOLUME directive is the same as the containerPath that's specified in the task definition, the data in the VOLUME directive path is copied to the data volume. In the following Dockerfile example, a file that's named examplefile in the /var/log/exported directory is written to the host and then mounted inside the container.
FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest RUN mkdir -p /var/log/exported RUN touch /var/log/exported/examplefile VOLUME ["/var/log/exported"]
By default, the volume permissions are set to 0755 and the owner as root. You can customize these permissions in the Dockerfile. The following example defines the owner of the directory as node.
FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest RUN yum install -y shadow-utils && yum clean all RUN useradd node RUN mkdir -p /var/log/exported && chown node:node /var/log/exported RUN touch /var/log/exported/examplefile USER node VOLUME ["/var/log/exported"]
Specifying a bind mount in your task definition
For Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate, the following task definition JSON snippet shows the syntax for the volumes, mountPoints, and ephemeralStorage objects for a task definition.

"sourceVolume" : "string" } ], "name" : "string" } ], ... "volumes" : [ { "name" : "string" } ], "ephemeralStorage": { "sizeInGiB": integer } }
The following describes each task definition parameter in more detail.
name
Type: String
Required: No
The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. This name is referenced in the sourceVolume parameter of container definition mountPoints. mountPoints
Type: Object Array
Required: No
The mount points for data volumes in your container.
This parameter maps to Volumes in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --volume option to docker run.
Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as $env:ProgramData. Windows containers cannot mount directories on a different drive, and mount point cannot be across drives. sourceVolume
Type: String
Required: Yes, when mountPoints are used
The name of the volume to mount. containerPath
Type: String
Required: Yes, when mountPoints are used
The path on the container to mount the volume at. readOnly
Type: Boolean
Required: No
133

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Bind mounts
If this value is true, the container has read-only access to the volume. If this value is false, then the container can write to the volume. The default value is false. ephemeralStorage
Type: Object
Required: No
The amount of ephemeral storage to allocate for the task. This parameter is used to expand the total amount of ephemeral storage available, beyond the default amount, for tasks hosted on AWS Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux) or 1.0.0 or later (Windows).
You can use the Copilot CLI, CloudFormation, the AWS SDK or the CLI to specify ephemeral storage for a bind mount.
Bind mount examples
The following examples cover the most common use cases for using a bind mount for your containers.
To allocate an increased amount of ephemeral storage space for a Fargate task
For Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate using platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux) or 1.0.0 (Windows), you can allocate more than the default amount of ephemeral storage for the containers in your task to use. This example can be incorporated into the other examples to allocate more ephemeral storage for your Fargate tasks.
· In the task definition, define an ephemeralStorage object. The sizeInGiB must be an integer between the values of 21 and 200 and is expressed in GiB.
"ephemeralStorage": { "sizeInGiB": integer
}
To provide an empty data volume for one or more containers
In some cases, you want to provide the containers in a task some scratch space. For example, you might have two database containers that need to access the same scratch file storage location during a task. This can be achieved using a bind mount.
1. In the task definition volumes section, define a bind mount with the name database_scratch.
"volumes": [ { "name": "database_scratch", }
]
2. In the containerDefinitions section, create the database container definitions. This is so that they mount the volume.
"containerDefinitions": [ { "name": "database1", "image": "my-repo/database", "cpu": 100, "memory": 100, "essential": true,
134

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Bind mounts
"mountPoints": [ { "sourceVolume": "database_scratch", "containerPath": "/var/scratch" }
] }, {
"name": "database2", "image": "my-repo/database", "cpu": 100, "memory": 100, "essential": true, "mountPoints": [
{ "sourceVolume": "database_scratch", "containerPath": "/var/scratch"
} ] } ]
To expose a path and its contents in a Dockerfile to a container
In this example, you have a Dockerfile that writes data that you want to mount inside a container.
1. Create a Dockerfile. The following example uses the public Amazon Linux 2 container image and creates a file that's named examplefile in the /var/log/exported directory that we want to mount inside the container. The VOLUME directive should specify an absolute path.
FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest RUN mkdir -p /var/log/exported RUN touch /var/log/exported/examplefile VOLUME ["/var/log/exported"]
By default, the volume permissions are set to 0755 and the owner as root. These permissions can be changed in the Dockerfile. In the following example, the owner of the /var/log/exported directory is set to node.
FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest RUN yum install -y shadow-utils && yum clean all RUN useradd node RUN mkdir -p /var/log/exported && chown node:node /var/log/exported RUN touch /var/log/exported/examplefile USER node VOLUME ["/var/log/exported"]
2. In the task definition volumes section, define a volume with the name application_logs.
"volumes": [ { "name": "application_logs", }
]
3. In the containerDefinitions section, create the application container definitions. This is so they mount the storage. The containerPath value must match the absolute path that's specified in the VOLUME directive from the Dockerfile.
"containerDefinitions": [

Fargate task networking
Important If you're using Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, see Task networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide for networking information that's relevant to your instances.
By default, every Amazon ECS task on Fargate is provided an elastic network interface (ENI) with a primary private IP address. When using a public subnet, you can optionally assign a public IP address to the task's ENI. If your VPC is enabled for dual-stack mode and you use a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block, your task's ENI also receives an IPv6 address. A task can only have one ENI that's associated with it at a time. Containers that belong to the same task can also communicate over the localhost interface. For more information about VPCs and subnets, see VPCs and subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
For a task on Fargate to pull a container image, the task must have a route to the internet. The following describes how you can verify that your task has a route to the internet.
· When using a public subnet, you can assign a public IP address to the task ENI. · When using a private subnet, the subnet can have a NAT gateway attached. · When using container images that are hosted in Amazon ECR, you can configure Amazon ECR to
use an interface VPC endpoint and the image pull occurs over the task's private IPv4 address. For more information, see Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.
Because each task gets its own ENI, you can use networking features such as VPC Flow Logs, which you can use to monitor traffic to and from your tasks. For more information, see VPC Flow Logs in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
You can also take advantage of AWS PrivateLink. You can configure an VPC interface endpoint so that you can access Amazon ECS APIs through private IP addresses. AWS PrivateLink restricts all network
136

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Fargate task networking considerations

traffic between your VPC and Amazon ECS to the Amazon network. You don't need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway. For more information, see AWS PrivateLink in the Amazon ECS Best Practices Guide.
The ENIs that are created are fully managed by AWS Fargate. Moreover, there's an associated IAM policy that's used to grant permissions for Fargate. For tasks using Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or later, the task receives a single ENI (referred to as the task ENI) and all network traffic flows through that ENI within your VPC. This traffic is recorded in your VPC flow logs. For tasks that use Fargate platform version 1.3.0 and earlier, in addition to the task ENI, the task also receives a separate Fargate owned ENI, which is used for some network traffic that isn't visible in the VPC flow logs. The following table describes the network traffic behavior and the required IAM policy for each platform version.

Fargate task networking considerations
Consider the following when using task networking.
· The Amazon ECS service-linked role is required to provide Amazon ECS with the permissions to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf. This role is created for you when you create a cluster or if you create or update a service in the AWS Management Console. For more information, see Servicelinked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348). You can also create the service-linked role using the following AWS CLI command.
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ecs.amazonaws.com
· Amazon ECS populates the hostname of the task with an Amazon provided DNS hostname when both the enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport options are enabled on your VPC. If these options aren't enabled, the DNS hostname of the task is set to a random hostname. For more

137

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using a VPC in dual-stack mode
information about the DNS settings for a VPC, see Using DNS with Your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide. · You can only specify up to 16 subnets and 5 security groups for awsvpcConfiguration. For more information, see AwsVpcConfiguration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference. · You can't manually detach or modify the ENIs that are created and attached by Fargate. This is to prevent the accidental deletion of an ENI that's associated with a running task. To release the ENIs for a task, stop the task. · If a VPC subnet is updated to change the DHCP options set it uses, you can't also apply these changes to existing tasks that use the VPC. Start new tasks, which will receive the new setting to smoothly migrate while testing the new change and then stop the old ones, if no rollback is required. · Tasks that are launched in subnets with IPv6 CIDR blocks only receive an IPv6 address when using Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or later for Linux or 1.0.0 for Windows. · For tasks that use platform version 1.4.0 or later for Linux or 1.0.0 for Windows, the task ENIs support jumbo frames. Network interfaces are configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU), which is the size of the largest payload that fits within a single frame. The larger the MTU, the more application payload can fit within a single frame, which reduces per-frame overhead and increases efficiency. Supporting jumbo frames reduces overhead when the network path between your task and the destination supports jumbo frames. · Services with tasks that use the Fargate launch type only support Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer. Classic Load Balancer isn't supported. When you create any target groups, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance. For more information, see Service load balancing (p. 252).
Using a VPC in dual-stack mode
When using a VPC in dual-stack mode, your tasks can communicate over IPv4 or IPv6, or both. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are independent of each other and you must configure routing and security in your VPC separately for IPv4 and IPv6. For more information about configuring your VPC for dual-stack mode, see Migrating to IPv6 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
If the following conditions are met, Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate are assigned an IPv6 address:
· Your VPC and subnet are enabled for IPv6. For more information about how to configure your VPC for dual-stack mode, see Migrating to IPv6 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
· The task or service uses Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or later for Linux or 1.0.0 for Windows. · The dualStackIPv6 account setting is enabled. For more information, see Account settings (p. 196).
If you configure your VPC with an internet gateway or an outbound-only internet gateway, Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate that are assigned an IPv6 address can access the internet. NAT gateways aren't needed. For more information, see Internet gateways and Egress-only internet gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Using the awslogs log driver
You can configure the containers in your tasks to send log information to CloudWatch Logs. If you do this, you can view the logs from the containers in your Fargate tasks. This topic goes over how you can get started using the awslogs log driver in your task definitions.
Note The type of information that is logged by the containers in your task depends mostly on their ENTRYPOINT command. By default, the logs that are captured show the command output that
138

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Turning on the awslogs log driver for your containers
you typically might see in an interactive terminal if you ran the container locally, which are the STDOUT and STDERR I/O streams. The awslogs log driver simply passes these logs from Docker to CloudWatch Logs. For more information about how Docker logs are processed, including alternative ways to capture different file data or streams, see View logs for a container or service in the Docker documentation.
Turning on the awslogs log driver for your containers
If you're using the Fargate launch type for your tasks, you need to add the required logConfiguration parameters to your task definition to turn on the awslogs log driver. For more information, see Specifying a log configuration in your task definition (p. 141).
Creating a log group
The awslogs log driver can send log streams to an existing log group in CloudWatch Logs or create a new log group on your behalf. The AWS Management Console provides an auto-configure option, which creates a log group on your behalf using the task definition family name with ecs as the prefix. Alternatively, you can manually specify your log configuration options and specify the awslogscreate-group option with a value of true, which creates the log groups on your behalf.
Note To use the awslogs-create-group option to have your log group created, your IAM policy must include the logs:CreateLogGroup permission.
The following code shows how to set the awslogs-create-group option.
{ "containerDefinitions": [ { "logConfiguration": { "logDriver": "awslogs", "options": { "awslogs-group": "firelens-container", "awslogs-region": "us-west-2", "awslogs-create-group": "true", "awslogs-stream-prefix": "firelens" } }
}
Using the auto-configuration feature to create a log group
When registering a task definition in the Amazon ECS console, you can allow Amazon ECS to autoconfigure your CloudWatch logs. Doing this causes a log group to be created on your behalf using the task definition family name with ecs as the prefix.
To use log group auto-configuration option in the Amazon ECS console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the left navigation pane, choose Task Definitions, Create new Task Definition. 3. Select your compatibility option and choose Next Step. 4. Choose Add container. 5. In the Storage and Logging section, for Log configuration, choose Auto-configure CloudWatch
Logs. 6. Enter your awslogs log driver options. For more information, see Specifying a log configuration in
your task definition (p. 141).
139

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Available awslogs log driver options
7. Complete the rest of the task definition wizard.
Available awslogs log driver options
The awslogs log driver supports the following options in Amazon ECS task definitions. For more information, see CloudWatch Logs logging driver.
awslogs-create-group
Required: No
Specify whether you want the log group to be created automatically. If this option isn't specified, it defaults to false.
Note Your IAM policy must include the logs:CreateLogGroup permission before you attempt to use awslogs-create-group. awslogs-region
Required: Yes
Specify the AWS Region that the awslogs log driver is to send your Docker logs to. You can choose to send all of your logs from clusters in different Regions to a single region in CloudWatch Logs. This is so that they're all visible in one location. Otherwise, you can separate them by Region for more granularity. Make sure that the specified log group exists in the Region that you specify with this option. awslogs-group
Required: Yes
Make sure to specify a log group that the awslogs log driver sends its log streams to. For more information, see Creating a log group (p. 139). awslogs-stream-prefix
Required: Yes, when using the Fargate launch type.
Use the awslogs-stream-prefix option to associate a log stream with the specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the container belongs to. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream takes the following format.
prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id
For Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix. Doing so you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container belongs to. awslogs-datetime-format
Required: No
This option defines a multiline start pattern in Python strftime format. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don't match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages.
One example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry.
140

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Specifying a log configuration in your task definition
For more information, see awslogs-datetime-format.
This option always takes precedence if both awslogs-datetime-format and awslogsmultiline-pattern are configured.
Note Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance. awslogs-multiline-pattern
Required: No
This option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don't match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages.
For more information, see awslogs-multiline-pattern.
This option is ignored if awslogs-datetime-format is also configured. Note Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance.
mode
Required: No
Valid values: non-blocking | blocking
Default value: blocking
The delivery mode of log messages from the container to awslogs. For more information, see Configure logging drivers. max-buffer-size
Required: No
Default value: 1m
When non-blocking mode is used, the max-buffer-size log option controls the size of the ring buffer that's used for intermediate message storage.
Specifying a log configuration in your task definition
Before your containers can send logs to CloudWatch, you must specify the awslogs log driver for containers in your task definition. This section describes the log configuration for a container to use the awslogs log driver. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66).
The task definition JSON that follows has a logConfiguration object specified for each container. One is for the WordPress container that sends logs to a log group called awslogs-wordpress. The other is for a MySQL container that sends logs to a log group that's called awslogs-mysql. Both containers use the awslogs-example log stream prefix.

Viewing awslogs container logs in CloudWatch Logs
After your Fargate tasks that use the awslogs log driver have launched, your configured containers should be sending their log data to CloudWatch Logs. You can view and search these logs in the console.
To view your CloudWatch Logs data for a container from the Amazon ECS console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. On the Clusters page, select the cluster that contains the task to view.
3. On the Cluster: cluster_name page, choose Tasks and select the task to view. 4. On the Task: task_id page, expand the container view by choosing the arrow to the left of the

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Custom log routing
Custom log routing
You can use FireLens for Amazon ECS to use task definition parameters to route logs to an AWS service or AWS Partner Network (APN) destination for log storage and analytics. FireLens works with Fluentd and Fluent Bit. We provide the AWS for Fluent Bit image or you can use your own Fluentd or Fluent Bit image. Creating Amazon ECS task definitions with a FireLens configuration is supported using the AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, and AWS Management Console.
Considerations
Consider the following when using FireLens for Amazon ECS: · FireLens for Amazon ECS is supported for tasks that are hosted on both AWS Fargate on Linux and
Amazon EC2. Windows containers that are on AWS Fargate don't support FireLens. · FireLens for Amazon ECS is supported in AWS CloudFormation templates. For more information, see
AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition FirelensConfiguration in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide · FireLens listens on port 24224, so to ensure that the FireLens log router isn't reachable outside of the
task, you must not allow inbound traffic on port 24224 in the security group your task uses. For tasks that use the awsvpc network mode, this is the security group associated with the task. For tasks using the host network mode, this is the security group that's associated with the Amazon EC2 instance
144

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Required IAM permissions
hosting the task. For tasks that use the bridge network mode, don't create any port mappings that use port 24224. · For tasks that use the bridge network mode, the container with the FireLens configuration must start before any application containers that rely on it start. To control the start order of your containers, use dependency conditions in your task definition. For more information, see Container dependency (p. 116).
Note If you use dependency condition parameters in container definitions with a FireLens configuration, ensure that each container has a START or HEALTHY condition requirement. · The Amazon ECS-optimized Bottlerocket AMI doesn't support FireLens. · By default, FireLens adds the cluster and task definition name and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster as metadata keys to your stdout/stderr container logs. The following is an example of the metadata format.
"ecs_cluster": "cluster-name", "ecs_task_arn": "arn:aws:ecs:region:111122223333:task/clustername/f2ad7dba413f45ddb4EXAMPLE", "ecs_task_definition": "task-def-name:revision",
If you do not want the metadata in your logs, set enable-ecs-log-metadata to false in the firelensConfiguration section of the task definition.
"firelensConfiguration":{ "type":"fluentbit", "options":{ "enable-ecs-log-metadata":"false", "config-file-type":"file", "config-file-value":"/extra.conf"
}
Required IAM permissions
To use this feature, you must create an IAM role for your tasks that provides the permissions necessary to use any AWS services that the tasks require. For example, if a container is routing logs to Kinesis Data Firehose, the task requires permission to call the firehose:PutRecordBatch API. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Identity Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
The following example IAM policy adds the required permissions for routing logs to Kinesis Data Firehose.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "firehose:PutRecordBatch" ], "Resource": [ "*" ] } ]
}
145

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Fluentd buffer limit
Your task may also require the Amazon ECS task execution role under the following conditions. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
· If your task is hosted on Fargate and you are pulling container images from Amazon ECR or referencing sensitive data from AWS Secrets Manager in your log configuration, then you must include the task execution IAM role.
· If you are specifying a custom configuration file that's hosted in Amazon S3, your task execution IAM role must include the s3:GetObject permission for the configuration file and the s3:GetBucketLocation permission on the Amazon S3 bucket that the file is in. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
The following example IAM policy adds the required permissions for retrieving a file from Amazon S3. Specify the name of your Amazon S3 bucket and configuration file name.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetObject" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/folder_name/config_file_name" ] }, { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetBucketLocation" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket" ] } ]
}
Fluentd buffer limit
When you create a task definition, you can specify the number of events that are buffered in memory by specifying the value (in bytes) in the log-driver-buffer-limit. For more information, see Fluentd logging driver in the Docker documentation.
Use this option when there's high throughput, because Docker might run out of buffer memory and discard buffer messages so it can add new messages. The lost logs might make it difficult to troubleshoot. Setting the buffer limit might help to prevent this issue.
The following shows the syntax for specifying the log-driver-buffer-limit:
{ "containerDefinitions": [ { "essential": true, "image": "906394416424.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-for-fluent-
bit:stable", "name": "log_router", "firelensConfiguration": { "type": "fluentbit"

"logDriver": "awslogs", "options": {
"awslogs-group": "firelens-container", "awslogs-region": "us-west-2", "awslogs-create-group": "true", "awslogs-stream-prefix": "firelens" } }, "memoryReservation": 50 }, { "essential": true, "image": "httpd", "name": "app", "logConfiguration": { "logDriver": "awsfirelens", "options": { "Name": "firehose", "region": "us-west-2", "delivery_stream": "my-stream", "log-driver-buffer-limit": "2097152" } }, "dependsOn": [ { "containerName": "log_router", "condition": "START" } ], "memoryReservation": 100 } ] }
Consider the following when using FireLens for Amazon ECS with the buffer limit option:
· This option is supported on the Amazon EC2 launch type and the Fargate launch type with platform version 1.4.0 or later.
· The option is only valid when logDriver is set to awsfirelens. · The default buffer limit is 1 MiB. · The valid values are 0 and 536870912 (512 MiB). · The total amount of memory allocated at the task level must be greater than the amount of memory
that's allocated for all the containers in addition to the memory buffer limit. The total amount of buffer memory specified must be less than 536870912 (512MiB) when you don't specify the container memory and memoryReservertion values. More specifically, you can have an app container with the awsfirelens log driver and the log-driver-buffer-limit option set to 300 MiB. However, you won't be allowed to run tasks if you have more than two containers with the log-driver-bufferlimit set to 300 MiB (300 MiB * 2 > 512 MiB).
Using Fluent logger libraries or Log4j over TCP
When the awsfirelens log driver is specified in a task definition, the Amazon ECS container agent injects the following environment variables into the container:
FLUENT_HOST
The IP address that's assigned to the FireLens container.
147

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using the AWS for Fluent Bit image
FLUENT_PORT The port that the Fluent Forward protocol is listening on.
You can use the FLUENT_HOST and FLUENT_PORT environment variables to log directly to the log router from code instead of going through stdout. For more information, see fluent-logger-golang on GitHub. · the section called "Using the AWS for Fluent Bit image" (p. 148) · the section called "Creating a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration" (p. 149) · the section called "Filtering logs using regular expressions" (p. 152) · the section called "Example task definitions" (p. 169)
Using the AWS for Fluent Bit image
AWS provides a Fluent Bit image with plugins for both CloudWatch Logs and Kinesis Data Firehose. We recommend using Fluent Bit as your log router because it has a lower resource utilization rate than Fluentd. For more information, see CloudWatch Logs for Fluent Bit and Amazon Kinesis Firehose for Fluent Bit.
The AWS for Fluent Bit image is available on Amazon ECR on both the Amazon ECR Public Gallery and in an Amazon ECR repository in most AWS Regions for high availability.
Amazon ECR Public Gallery
The AWS for Fluent Bit image is available on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. This is the recommended location to download the AWS for Fluent Bit image because it's a public repository and available to be used from all AWS Regions. For more information, see aws-for-fluent-bit on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.
You can pull the AWS for Fluent Bit image from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery by specifying the repository URL with the desired image tag. The available image tags can be found on the Image tags tab on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.
The following shows the syntax to use for the Docker CLI.
docker pull public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-for-fluent-bit:tag
For example, you can pull the latest stable AWS for Fluent Bit image using this Docker CLI command.
docker pull public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-for-fluent-bit:stable
Note Unauthenticated pulls are allowed, but have a lower rate limit than authenticated pulls. To authenticate using your AWS account before pulling, use the following command.
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws
Amazon ECR
The AWS for Fluent Bit image is available on Amazon ECR for high availability. These images are available in most AWS Regions, including AWS GovCloud (US).
148

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration
The latest stable AWS for Fluent Bit image URI can be retrieved using the following command.
aws ssm get-parameters \ --names /aws/service/aws-for-fluent-bit/stable \ --region us-east-1
All versions of the AWS for Fluent Bit image can be listed using the following command to query the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter.
aws ssm get-parameters-by-path \ --path /aws/service/aws-for-fluent-bit \ --region us-east-1
The latest stable AWS for Fluent Bit image can be referenced in an AWS CloudFormation template by referencing the Systems Manager parameter store name. The following is an example:
Parameters: FireLensImage: Description: Fluent Bit image for the FireLens Container Type: AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String> Default: /aws/service/aws-for-fluent-bit/stable
Creating a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration
To use custom log routing with FireLens, you must specify the following in your task definition:
· A log router container that contains a FireLens configuration. We recommend that the container be marked as essential.
· One or more application containers that contain a log configuration specifying the awsfirelens log driver.
· A task IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that contains the permissions needed for the task to route the logs.
When creating a new task definition using the AWS Management Console, there is a FireLens integration section that makes it easy to add a log router container. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66).
Amazon ECS converts the log configuration and generates the Fluentd or Fluent Bit output configuration. The output configuration is mounted in the log routing container at /fluent-bit/etc/ fluent-bit.conf for Fluent Bit and /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf for Fluentd.
Important FireLens listens on port 24224. Therefore, to ensure that the FireLens log router isn't reachable outside of the task, you must not allow ingress traffic on port 24224 in the security group your task uses. For tasks that use the awsvpc network mode, this is the security group that's associated with the task. For tasks that use the host network mode, this is the security group that's associated with the Amazon EC2 instance hosting the task. For tasks that use the bridge network mode, don't create any port mappings that use port 24224.
The following task definition example defines a log router container that uses Fluent Bit to route its logs to CloudWatch Logs. It also defines an application container that uses a log configuration to route logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and sets the memory that's used to buffer events to the 2 MiB.

"Name": "firehose", "region": "us-west-2", "delivery_stream": "my-stream", "log-driver-buffer-limit": "2097152" } }, "memoryReservation": 100 } ] }
The key-value pairs specified as options in the logConfiguration object are used to generate the Fluentd or Fluent Bit output configuration. The following is a code example from a Fluent Bit output definition.
[OUTPUT] Name firehose Match app-firelens* region us-west-2 delivery_stream my-stream
Note FireLens manages the match configuration. This configuration isn't specified in your task definition.
Using Amazon ECS metadata
When specifying a FireLens configuration in a task definition, you can optionally toggle the value for enable-ecs-log-metadata. By default, Amazon ECS adds additional fields in your log entries that help identify the source of the logs. You can disable this action by setting enable-ecs-log-metadata to false.
150

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration
· ecs_cluster ­ The name of the cluster that the task is part of. · ecs_task_arn ­ The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that the container is part of. · ecs_task_definition ­ The task definition name and revision that the task is using.
The following shows the syntax required when specifying an Amazon ECS log metadata setting value.
{ "containerDefinitions":[ { "essential":true, "image":"906394416424.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-for-fluent-bit:stable", "name":"log_router", "firelensConfiguration":{ "type":"fluentbit", "options":{ "enable-ecs-log-metadata":"true | false" } } } ]
}
Specifying a custom configuration file
In addition to the auto-generated configuration file that FireLens creates on your behalf, you can also specify a custom configuration file. The configuration file format is the native format for the log router that you're using. For more information, see Fluentd Config File Syntax and Fluent Bit Configuration File.
In your custom configuration file, for tasks using the bridge or awsvpc network mode, don't set a Fluentd or Fluent Bit forward input over TCP because FireLens adds it to the input configuration.
Your FireLens configuration must contain the following options to specify a custom configuration file:
config-file-type
The source location of the custom configuration file. The available options are s3 or file. Note Tasks that are hosted on AWS Fargate only support the file configuration file type.
config-file-value
The source for the custom configuration file. If the s3 config file type is used, the config file value is the full ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket and file. If the file config file type is used, the config file value is the full path of the configuration file that exists either in the container image or on a volume that's mounted in the container.
Important When using a custom configuration file, you must specify a different path than the one FireLens uses. Amazon ECS reserves the /fluent-bit/etc/fluent-bit.conf filepath for Fluent Bit and /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf for Fluentd.
The following example shows the syntax required when specifying a custom configuration.
Important To specify a custom configuration file that's hosted in Amazon S3, ensure you have created a task execution IAM role with the proper permissions. For more information, see Required IAM permissions (p. 145).

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Filtering logs using regular expressions
The following shows the syntax required when specifying a custom configuration.
{ "containerDefinitions":[ { "essential":true, "image":"906394416424.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-for-fluent-bit:stable", "name":"log_router", "firelensConfiguration":{ "type":"fluentbit", "options":{ "config-file-type":"s3 | file", "config-file-value":"arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/fluent.conf | filepath" } } } ]
}
Note Tasks hosted on AWS Fargate only support the file configuration file type.
Filtering logs using regular expressions
Fluentd and Fluent Bit both support filtering of logs based on their content. FireLens provides a simple method for enabling this filtering. In the log configuration options in a container definition, you can specify the special keys exclude-pattern and include-pattern that take regular expressions as their values. The exclude-pattern key causes all logs that match its regular expression to be dropped. With include-pattern, only logs that match its regular expression are sent. These keys can be used together.
The following example demonstrates how to use this filter.
{ "containerDefinitions":[ { "logConfiguration":{ "logDriver":"awsfirelens", "options":{ "@type":"cloudwatch_logs", "log_group_name":"firelens-testing", "auto_create_stream":"true", "use_tag_as_stream":"true", "region":"us-west-2", "exclude-pattern":"^[a-z][aeiou].*$", "include-pattern":"^.*[aeiou]$" } } } ]
}
Concatenate multiline or stack-trace log messages
Beginning with AWS for Fluent Bit version 2.22.0, a multiline filter is included. The multiline filter helps concatenate log messages that originally belong to one context but were split across multiple records or log lines. For more information on the multiline filter, see the Fluent Bit documentation.
Common examples of split log messages are:
152

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Concatenate multiline or stack-trace log messages · Stack traces. Follow the steps below to concatenate messages split by newlines. · Applications that print logs on multiple lines. Follow the steps below to concatenate messages split by newlines. · Log messages that were split because they were longer than the specified runtime max buffer size. You can concatenate log messages split by the container runtime by following the example on GitHub: FireLens Example: Concatenate Partial/Split Container Logs. Compare the images of the logs below to determine if you need the multiline filter. Before The following image shows the CloudWatch Logs console with the default log setting with multiple entries for each line in a stack trace.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Concatenate multiline or stack-trace log messages
After The following image shows the CloudWatch Logs console with the multiline log setting with a single entry that includes all the lines in a stack trace in the log field.
To parse logs and concatenate lines that were split because of newlines, you can use either of these two options. · Create your own parser file that contains the rules to parse and concatenate lines that belong to the
same message. · Use a Fluent Bit built-in parser. For a list of languages supported by the Fluent Bit built-in parsers, see
Fluent Bit documentation. The following tutorial walks you through the steps for each use case. The steps show you how to concatenate multilines and send the logs to Amazon CloudWatch. You can specify a different destination for your logs.
Required IAM permissions
For each use case you must first make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions for the container agent to pull the container images from Amazon ECR and for the container to route logs to CloudWatch Logs. For these permissions, you must have the following roles: · A task IAM role. · An Amazon ECS task execution IAM role. Create the task IAM role This task role grants the FireLens log router container the permissions needed to route the logs to the destination. In this example we are routing the logs to CloudWatch Logs. To create this role, create a policy with the permissions to create a log stream, log group, and write log events. Then associate the policy to the role.
155

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Concatenate multiline or stack-trace log messages
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Policies and then choose Create Policy. 3. Choose JSON and paste the following permissions:
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:PutLogEvents" ], "Resource": "*" }]
}
4. Choose Next: Tags and add any tags to the policy to help you organize them. Then choose Next: Review.
5. On the Review policy page, for Name type a unique name for the policy. In this example, we will use ecs-policy-for-firelens. You may specify an optional description for the policy as well.
6. Choose Create policy to finish. 7. In the navigation pane, choose Roles and then choose Create Roles. 8. In the Trusted entity type section, choose AWS service. 9. For Use case, choose Elastic Container Service.. 10. Choose Elastic Container Service Task and then Next. 11. Associate the role with the ecs-policy-for-firelens policy you created and choose Next. 12. Enter a unique name for the role. In this example, use: ecs-task-role-for-firelens.
Verify that you have an Amazon ECS task execution IAM role
You must have a task execution role to grant the container agent permission to pull the container images from Amazon ECR.
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles and then search for ecsTaskExecutionRole. 3. If you do not see the ecsTaskExecutionRole role, you must create the role. For information on
how to create the role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Example: Use a parser that you create
In this example, you will complete the following steps:
1. Build and upload the image for a Fluent Bit container. 2. Build and upload the image for a demo multiline application that runs, fails, and generates a multiline
stack trace. 3. Create the task definition and run the task. 4. View the logs to verify that messages that span multiple lines appear concatenated.

Parsing container logs that are serialized JSON
Note For more examples, see Amazon ECS FireLens examples on GitHub.
Beginning with AWS for Fluent Bit version 1.3, there's a JSON parser that's included in the AWS for Fluent Bit image. The following example shows how to reference the JSON parser in the FireLens configuration of your task definition.
"firelensConfiguration": { "type": "fluentbit", "options": { "config-file-type": "file", "config-file-value": "/fluent-bit/configs/parse-json.conf" }
},
The Fluent Bit config file parses any logs that are in JSON (for example, if the logs at your destination looked like the following without JSON parsing).
{ "source": "stdout", "log": "{\"requestID\": \"b5d716fca19a4252ad90e7b8ec7cc8d2\", \"requestInfo\":
{\"ipAddress\": \"204.16.5.19\", \"path\": \"/activate\", \"user\": \"TheDoctor\"}}", "container_id": "e54cccfac2b87417f71877907f67879068420042828067ae0867e60a63529d35", "container_name": "/ecs-demo-6-container2-a4eafbb3d4c7f1e16e00" "ecs_cluster": "mycluster", "ecs_task_arn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-2:01234567891011:task/

}
With the JSON parsing, the log looks like the following.
{ "source": "stdout", "container_id": "e54cccfac2b87417f71877907f67879068420042828067ae0867e60a63529d35",

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Private registry authentication for tasks
Private registry authentication for tasks
Private registry authentication for tasks using AWS Secrets Manager enables you to store your credentials securely and then reference them in your task definition. This provides a way to reference container images that exist in private registries outside of AWS that require authentication in your task definitions. This feature is supported by tasks hosted on Fargate, Amazon EC2 instances, and external instances using Amazon ECS Anywhere.
Important If your task definition references an image that's stored in Amazon ECR, this topic doesn't apply. For more information, see Using Amazon ECR Images with Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.
For tasks hosted on Fargate, this feature requires platform version 1.2.0 or later. For information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
Within your container definition, specify the repositoryCredentials object with the details of the secret that you created. The secret you reference can be from a different AWS Region or a different account than the task using it.
Note When using the Amazon ECS API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK, if the secret exists in the same AWS Region as the task that you're launching then you can use either the full ARN or name of the secret. If the secret exists in a different account, the full ARN of the secret must be specified. When using the AWS Management Console, the full ARN of the secret must be specified always.
The following is a snippet of a task definition that shows the required parameters:
"containerDefinitions": [ { "image": "private-repo/private-image", "repositoryCredentials": { "credentialsParameter":
"arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:aws_account_id:secret:secret_name" }
} ]
Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication
The Amazon ECS task execution role is required to use this feature. This allows the container agent to pull the container image. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
To provide access to the secrets that you create, add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
· secretsmanager:GetSecretValue · kms:Decrypt--Required only if your key uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) for your custom key must be added as a resource.
The following is an example inline policy that adds the permissions.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow",

Enabling private registry authentication
To create a basic secret
Use AWS Secrets Manager to create a secret for your private registry credentials.
1. Open the AWS Secrets Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/. 2. Choose Store a new secret. 3. For Select secret type, choose Other type of secrets. 4. Select Plaintext and enter your private registry credentials using the following format:
{ "username" : "privateRegistryUsername", "password" : "privateRegistryPassword"
}
5. Choose Next. 6. For Secret name, enter an optional path and name, such as production/MyAwesomeAppSecret
or development/TestSecret, and choose Next. You can optionally add a description to help you remember the purpose of this secret later.
The secret name must be ASCII letters, digits, or any of the following characters: /_+=.@-. 7. (Optional) At this point, you can configure rotation for your secret. For this procedure, leave it at
Disable automatic rotation and choose Next.
For instructions on how to configure rotation on new or existing secrets, see Rotating Your AWS Secrets Manager Secrets. 8. Review your settings, and then choose Store secret to save everything that you entered as a new secret in Secrets Manager.
To create a task definition that uses private registry authentication
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions. 3. On the task definitions page, choose Create new task definition. 4. On the Select launch type compatibility page, choose the launch type for your tasks and then Next
step. 5. For task definition Name, enter a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and
lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. 6. For Task execution role, either select your existing task execution role or choose Create new role.
This role authorizes Amazon ECS to pull private images for your task. For more information, see Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication (p. 174).

Specifying sensitive data
You can use Amazon ECS to inject sensitive data into your containers by storing your sensitive data in either AWS Secrets Manager secrets or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters and then referencing them in your container definition.
Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:
· To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.
· To reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.
Topics · Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager (p. 176) · Specifying sensitive data using Systems Manager Parameter Store (p. 182)
Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager
Amazon ECS enables you to inject sensitive data into your containers by storing your sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager secrets and then referencing them in your container definition. Sensitive data stored in Secrets Manager secrets can be exposed to a container as environment variables or as part of the log configuration.
When you inject a secret as an environment variable, you can specify the full contents of a secret, a specific JSON key within a secret, or a specific version of a secret to inject. This helps you control the sensitive data exposed to your container. For more information about secret versioning, see Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Secrets Manager
Considerations for specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager
Consider the following when using Secrets Manager to specify sensitive data for containers.
· For Amazon ECS tasks on AWS Fargate, consider the following: · To inject the full content of a secret as an environment variable or in a log configuration, you must use platform version 1.3.0 or later. For information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58). · To inject a specific JSON key or version of a secret as an environment variable or in a log configuration, you must use platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux) or 1.0.0 (Windows). For information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
· Only secrets that store text data, which are secrets created with the SecretString parameter of the CreateSecret API, are supported. Secrets that store binary data, which are secrets created with the SecretBinary parameter of the CreateSecret API aren't supported.
· When using a task definition that references Secrets Manager secrets to retrieve sensitive data for your containers, if you're also using interface VPC endpoints, you must create the interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager. For more information, see Using Secrets Manager with VPC Endpoints in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
· Sensitive data is injected into your container when the container is initially started. If the secret is subsequently updated or rotated, the container doesn't receive the updated value automatically. You must either launch a new task or if your task is part of a service that you can update the service and use the Force new deployment option to force the service to launch a fresh task.
· The VPC your task uses must have DNS resolution enabled.
Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets
To use this feature, you must have the Amazon ECS task execution role and reference it in your task definition. This allows the container agent to pull the necessary Secrets Manager resources. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
To provide access to the Secrets Manager secrets that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
· secretsmanager:GetSecretValue­Required if you're referencing a Secrets Manager secret. · kms:Decrypt­Required only if your secret uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The ARN
for your custom key must be added as a resource.
The following example inline policy adds the required permissions.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", "kms:Decrypt" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<aws_account_id>:secret:<secret_name>", "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<aws_account_id>:key/<key_id>" ] } ]
177

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Secrets Manager
}
Injecting sensitive data as an environment variable
Within your container definition, you can specify the following:
· The secrets object containing the name of the environment variable to set in the container · The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Secrets Manager secret · Additional parameters that contain the sensitive data to present to the container
The following example shows the full syntax that must be specified for the Secrets Manager secret.
arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:aws_account_id:secret:secret-name
The following section describes the additional parameters. These parameters are optional, but if you don't use them, you must include the colons : to use the default values. Examples are provided below for more context.
json-key Specifies the name of the key in a key-value pair with the value that you want to set as the environment variable value. Only values in JSON format are supported. If you don't specify a JSON key, then the full contents of the secret is used.
version-stage Specifies the staging label of the version of a secret that you want to use. If a version staging label is specified, you can't specify a version ID. If no version stage is specified, the default behavior is to retrieve the secret with the AWSCURRENT staging label. Staging labels are used to keep track of different versions of a secret when they're either updated or rotated. Each version of a secret has one or more staging labels and an ID. For more information, see Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
version-id Specifies the unique identifier of the version of a secret that you want to use. If a version ID is specified, you can't specify a version staging label. If no version ID is specified, the default behavior is to retrieve the secret with the AWSCURRENT staging label. Version IDs are used to keep track of different versions of a secret when they're either updated or rotated. Each version of a secret has an ID. For more information, see Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
For a full tutorial on ho to create a Secrets Manager secret and inject it into a container as an environment variable, see Tutorial: Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager secrets (p. 408).

Creating an AWS Secrets Manager secret
You can use the Secrets Manager console to create a secret for your sensitive data. For more information, see Creating a Basic Secret in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
To create a basic secret
Use Secrets Manager to create a secret for your sensitive data.
180

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Secrets Manager
1. Open the Secrets Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/. 2. Choose Store a new secret. 3. For Select secret type, choose Other type of secrets. 4. Specify the details of your custom secret as Key and Value pairs. For example, you can specify a key
of UserName, and then supply the appropriate user name as its value. Add a second key with the name of Password and the password text as its value. You could also add entries for a database name, server address, and TCP port, and so on. You can add as many pairs as you need to store the information that you require.
Alternatively, you can choose the Plaintext tab and enter the secret value in any way you like. 5. Choose the AWS KMS encryption key that you want to use to encrypt the protected text in the
secret. If you don't choose one, Secrets Manager checks to see if there's a default key for the account, and uses it if it exists. If a default key doesn't exist, Secrets Manager creates one for you automatically. You can also choose Add new key to create a custom KMS key specifically for this secret. To create your own KMS key, you must have permissions to create KMS keys in your account. 6. Choose Next. 7. For Secret name, type an optional path and name, such as production/MyAwesomeAppSecret or development/TestSecret, and choose Next. You can optionally add a description to help you remember the purpose of this secret later.
The secret name must be ASCII letters, digits, or any of the following characters: /_+=.@-. 8. (Optional) At this point, you can configure rotation for your secret. For this procedure, leave it at
Disable automatic rotation and choose Next.
For information about how to configure rotation on new or existing secrets, see Rotating Your AWS Secrets Manager Secrets. 9. Review your settings, and then choose Store secret to save everything that you entered as a new secret in Secrets Manager.
Creating a task definition in the classic console that references sensitive data

Specifying sensitive data using Systems Manager Parameter Store
You can use Amazon ECS to inject sensitive data into your containers by storing your sensitive data in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters and then referencing them in your container definition.
Topics · Considerations for specifying sensitive data using Systems Manager Parameter Store (p. 182) · Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets (p. 183) · Injecting sensitive data as an environment variable (p. 183) · Injecting sensitive data in a log configuration (p. 184) · Creating an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter (p. 184) · Creating a Task Definition in the classic console that references sensitive data (p. 185)
Considerations for specifying sensitive data using Systems Manager Parameter Store
Consider the following when specifying sensitive data for containers using Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters.
· The Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter must exist in the same account that the tasks are run in.
182

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Systems Manager Parameter Store
· For tasks hosted on Fargate, this feature requires that your task use platform version 1.3.0 or later (for Linux) or 1.0.0 or later (for Windows). For information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
· Sensitive data is injected into your container when the container is initially started. If the secret or Parameter Store parameter is subsequently updated or rotated, the container doesn't receive the updated value automatically. You must either launch a new task or if your task is part of a service you can update the service and use the Force new deployment option to force the service to launch a fresh task.
Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets
To use this feature, you must have the Amazon ECS task execution role and reference it in your task definition. This allows the container agent to pull the necessary AWS Systems Manager resources. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
To provide access to the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
· ssm:GetParameters--Required if you're referencing a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter in a task definition.
· secretsmanager:GetSecretValue--Required if you're referencing a Secrets Manager secret either directly or if your Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter is referencing a Secrets Manager secret in a task definition.
· kms:Decrypt--Required only if your secret uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The ARN for your custom key must be added as a resource.
The following example inline policy adds the required permissions:
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ssm:GetParameters", "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", "kms:Decrypt" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:ssm:<region>:<aws_account_id>:parameter/<parameter_name>", "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<aws_account_id>:secret:<secret_name>", "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<aws_account_id>:key/<key_id>" ] } ]
}
Injecting sensitive data as an environment variable
Within your container definition, specify secrets with the name of the environment variable to set in the container and the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that contains the sensitive data to present to the container.
The following is a snippet of a task definition that shows the format that's used when referencing a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter. If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the task you are launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.
183

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Systems Manager Parameter Store
{ "containerDefinitions": [{ "secrets": [{ "name": "environment_variable_name", "valueFrom": "arn:aws:ssm:region:aws_account_id:parameter/parameter_name" }] }]
}
Injecting sensitive data in a log configuration
Within your container definition, when specifying a logConfiguration, you can specify secretOptions with the name of the log driver option to set in the container and the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that contains the sensitive data to present to the container.
Important If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same AWS Region as the task you are launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.
The following is a snippet of a task definition showing the format when referencing a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter.
{ "containerDefinitions": [{ "logConfiguration": [{ "logDriver": "fluentd", "options": { "tag": "fluentd demo" }, "secretOptions": [{ "name": "fluentd-address", "valueFrom": "arn:aws:ssm:region:aws_account_id:parameter/parameter_name" }] }] }]
}
Creating an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter
You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to create a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter for your sensitive data. For more information, see Walkthrough: Create and Use a Parameter in a Command (Console) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
To create a Parameter Store parameter
1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Parameter Store and then Create parameter. 3. For Name, enter a hierarchy and a parameter name (for example, /test/database_password). 4. For Description, type an optional description. 5. For Type, choose String, StringList, or SecureString.
Note
· If you choose SecureString, the KMS key ID field appears. If you don't provide a KMS key ID, a KMS key ARN, an alias name, or an alias ARN, then the system uses alias/aws/
184

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Systems Manager Parameter Store
ssm. This is the default KMS key for Systems Manager. To avoid using this key, choose a custom key. For more information, see Use Secure String Parameters in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. · When you create a secure string parameter in the console by using the key-id parameter with either a custom KMS key alias name or an alias ARN, you must specify the prefix alias/ before the alias. The following is an ARN example:
arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
The following is an alias name example:
alias/MyAliasName
6. For Value, type a value. For example, MyFirstParameter. If you chose SecureString, the value is masked as you type.
7. Choose Create parameter.
Creating a Task Definition in the classic console that references sensitive data
You can use the Amazon ECS console to create a task definition that references a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter.
To create a task definition that specifies a secret
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose task definitions, Create New Task Definition. 3. On the Select launch type compatibility page, choose the launch type for your tasks and choose
Next step. 4. For task definition Name, type a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and
lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. 5. For Task execution role, either select your existing task execution role or choose Create new
role. The role that's created authorizes Amazon ECS to pull private images for your task. For more information, see Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication (p. 174).
Important If the Task execution role field doesn't appear, choose Configure via JSON and add the executionRoleArn field to specify your task execution role. The following code shows the syntax:
"executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"
6. For each container to create in your task definition, complete the following steps:
a. Under Container Definitions, choose Add container. b. For Container name, type a name for your container. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and
lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. c. For Image, type the image name or path to your private image. Up to 255 letters (uppercase
and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. d. Expand Advanced container configuration. e. For sensitive data to inject as environment variables, under Environment, for Environment
variables, complete the following fields:
185

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Specifying environment variables

ii. For Value, choose ValueFrom. For Add value, enter the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that contains the data to present to your container as an environment variable. Note If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same AWS Region as the task you are launching, you can use either the full ARN or name of the secret. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.
f. For secrets referenced in the log configuration for a container, under Storage and Logging, for Log configuration, complete the following fields:
i. Clear the Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs option. ii. Under Log options, for Key, enter the name of the log configuration option to set. iii. For Value, choose ValueFrom. For Add value, enter the name or full ARN of the AWS
Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that contains the data to present to your log configuration as a log option.
Note If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same AWS Region as the task you are launching, you can use either the full ARN or the name of the secret. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified. g. Fill out the remaining required fields and any optional fields to use in your container definitions. More container definition parameters are available in the Advanced container configuration menu. For more information, see Task definition parameters (p. 97). h. Choose Add. 7. When your containers are added, choose Create.
Specifying environment variables
Important We recommend storing your sensitive data in either AWS Secrets Manager secrets or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data (p. 176). Environment variables specified in the task definition are readable by all IAM users and roles that are allowed the DescribeTaskDefinition action for the task definition. Environment variable files are objects in Amazon S3 and all Amazon S3 security considerations apply. See the below section the section called "Required IAM permissions" (p. 188).
You can pass environment variables to your containers in the following ways:
· Individually using the environment container definition parameter. This maps to the --env option to docker run.
· In bulk, using the environmentFiles container definition parameter to list one or more files that contain the environment variables. The file must be hosted in Amazon S3. This maps to the --envfile option to docker run.
By specifying environment variables in a file, you can bulk inject environment variables. Within your container definition, specify the environmentFiles object with a list of Amazon S3 buckets containing your environment variable files. The files must use an .env file extension and there is a limit of ten files to a task definition.
186

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Considerations for specifying environment variable files
We don't enforce a size limit on the environment variables, but a large environment variables file might fill up the disk space. Each task that uses an environment variables file causes a copy of the file to be downloaded to disk. We remove the file as part of the task cleanup.
The following is a snippet of a task definition showing how to specify individual environment variables.
{ "family": "", "containerDefinitions": [ { "name": "", "image": "", ... "environment": [ { "name": "variable", "value": "value" } ], ... } ], ...
}
The following is a snippet of a task definition showing how to specify an environment variable file.
{ "family": "", "containerDefinitions": [ { "name": "", "image": "", ... "environmentFiles": [ { "value": "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name/envfile_object_name.env", "type": "s3" } ], ... } ], ...
}
Considerations for specifying environment variable files
Consider the following when specifying an environment variable file in a container definition.
· For Amazon ECS tasks on AWS Fargate, your tasks must use platform version 1.4.0 or later (Linux) to use this feature. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
Verify that the variable is supported for the operating system platform. For more information, see the section called "Container definitions" (p. 100) and the section called "Other task definition parameters" (p. 123).
· The file must use the .env file extension and UTF-8 encoding.
187

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Required IAM permissions
· Each line in an environment file must contain an environment variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Spaces or quotation marks are included as part of the values. Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and are ignored. For more information about the environment variable file syntax, see Declare default environment variables in file.
The following is the appropriate syntax.
#This is a comment and will be ignored VARIABLE=VALUE ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION
· If there are environment variables specified using the environment parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained within an environment file.
· If multiple environment files are specified and they contain the same variable, they're processed in order of entry. This means that the first value of the variable is used and subsequent values of duplicate variables are ignored. We recommend that you use unique variable names.
· If an environment file is specified as a container override, it's used. Moreover, any other environment files that are specified in the container definition is ignored.
Required IAM permissions
The Amazon ECS task execution role is required to use this feature. This allows the container agent to pull the environment variable file from Amazon S3. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
To provide access to the Amazon S3 objects that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. Use the Resource parameter to scope the permission to the Amazon S3 buckets that contain the environment variable files. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
· s3:GetObject · s3:GetBucketLocation
In the following example, the permissions are added to the inline policy.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetObject" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/folder_name/env_file_name" ] }, { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetBucketLocation" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket" ] } ]

Updating a task definition using the classic console
A task definition revision is a copy of the current task definition with the new parameter values replacing the existing ones. All parameters that you do not modify are in the new revision.
To update a task definition, create a task definition revision. If the task definition is used in a service, you must update that service to use the updated task definition.
To create a task definition revision
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains your task definition. 3. In the navigation pane, choose task definitions. 4. On the task definitions page, select the box to the left of the task definition to revise and choose
Create new revision. 5. On the Create new revision of task definition page, make changes. For example, to change the
existing container definitions (such as the container image, memory limits, or port mappings), select the container, make the changes, and then choose Update. 6. Verify the information and choose Create. 7. If your task definition is used in a service, update your service with the updated task definition. For more information, see Updating a service (p. 237).
Deregistering a task definition revision
If you decide that you no longer need a specific task definition revision in Amazon ECS, you can deregister the task definition revision so that it no longer displays in your ListTaskDefinition API calls or in the console when you want to run a task or update a service.
194

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Deregistering a task definition revision
When you deregister a task definition revision, it's immediately marked as INACTIVE. Existing tasks and services that reference an INACTIVE task definition revision continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an INACTIVE task definition revision can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count. You can't use an INACTIVE task definition revision to run new tasks or create new services. You also can't update an existing service to reference an INACTIVE task definition revision. This is despite that there might be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not already taken effect.
Note At this time, INACTIVE task definition revisions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future. Therefore, don't rely on INACTIVE task definition revisions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services. To deregister a new task definition (Classic Amazon ECS console) 1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains your task definition. 3. In the navigation pane, choose task definitions. 4. On the task definitions page, choose the task definition family that contains one or more revisions that you want to deregister. 5. On the task definition Name page, select the box to the left of each task definition revision that you want to deregister. 6. Choose Actions, Deregister. 7. Verify the information in the Deregister task definition window, and then choose Deregister to finish.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate
Account settings
Amazon ECS provides account settings, which provide a way to opt in or out of specific features. For each Region, you can opt in to or opt out of each account setting at the account level or for a specific IAM user or role.
The following are supported scenarios:
· An IAM user or role can opt in or opt out for their individual user account. · An IAM user or role can set the default opt in or opt out setting for all users on the account. · The root user can opt in to or opt out of any specific IAM role or user on the account. If the account
setting for the root user is changed, it sets the default for all the IAM users and roles for which no individual account setting has been selected.
Note Federated users assume the account setting of the root user and can't have explicit account settings set for them.
The following account settings are available. The opt in and opt out option must be selected for each account setting separately.
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs
Resource names: serviceLongArnFormat, taskLongArnFormat, and containerInstanceLongArnFormat
Amazon ECS is introducing a new format for Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and resource IDs for Amazon ECS services, tasks, and container instances. The opt-in status for each resource type determines the ARN format the resource uses. You must opt-in to the new ARN format to use features such as resource tagging for that resource type. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs (p. 197).
Only resources launched after opting in receive the new ARN and resource ID format. All existing resources are not affected. In order for Amazon ECS services and tasks to transition to the new ARN and resource ID formats, the service or task must be re-created. To transition a container instance to the new ARN and resource ID format, the container instance must be drained and a new container instance registered to the cluster.
Note Tasks launched by an Amazon ECS service can only receive the new ARN and resource ID format if the service was created on or after November 16, 2018, and the IAM user who created the service has opted in to the new format for tasks. CloudWatch Container Insights
Resource name: containerInsights
CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly. You can also set CloudWatch alarms on metrics that Container Insights collects. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
196

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs
When you opt in to the containerInsights account setting, all new clusters have Container Insights enabled by default. You can disable this setting for specific clusters when you create them. You can also change this setting by using the UpdateClusterSettings API. Dual-stack VPC IPv6
Resource name: dualStackIPv6
Amazon ECS supports providing tasks with an IPv6 address in addition to the primary private IPv4 address.
For tasks to receive an IPv6 address, the task must use the awsvpc network mode, must be launched in a VPC configured for dual-stack mode, and the dualStackIPv6 account setting must be enabled. For more information on other requirements, see Using a VPC in dual-stack mode (p. 138).
Important The dualStackIPv6 account setting can only be changed using either the Amazon ECS API or the AWS CLI. For more information, see Modifying account settings (p. 199).
If you had a running task using the awsvpc network mode in an IPv6 enabled subnet between the dates of October 1, 2020 and November 2, 2020, the default dualStackIPv6 account setting in the Region the task was running in is disabled. If that condition is not met, the default dualStackIPv6 setting in the Region is enabled.

Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs
When Amazon ECS resources are created, each resource is assigned a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource identifier (ID). If you are using a command line tool or the Amazon ECS API to work with Amazon ECS, resource ARNs or IDs are required for certain commands. For example, if you are using the stop-task AWS CLI command to stop a task, you must specify the task ARN or ID in the command.
The ability to opt in to and opt out of the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format is provided on a per-Region basis. Currently, any new account created is opted in by default.
You can opt in or opt out of the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format at any time. After you have opted in, any new resources that you create use the new format.
Note A resource ID does not change after it's created. Therefore, opting in or out of the new format does not affect your existing resource IDs.
The following sections describe how ARN and resource ID formats are changing. For more information on the transition to the new formats, see Amazon Elastic Container Service FAQ.
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format
Some resources have a user-friendly name, such as a service named production. In other cases, you must specify a resource using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format. The new ARN format for Amazon ECS tasks, services, and container instances includes the cluster name. For information about opting in to the new ARN format, see Modifying account settings (p. 199).
197

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate ARN and resource ID format timeline

The following table shows both the current (old) format and the new format for each resource type.

Resource type ARN

Container instance

Old: arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:containerinstance/container-instance-id

New: arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:containerinstance/cluster-name/container-instance-id

Amazon ECS service

Old: arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/service-name

Amazon ECS task Old: arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:task/task-id

New: arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:task/cluster-name/taskid

Resource ID length
A resource ID takes the form of a unique combination of letters and numbers. New resource ID formats include shorter IDs for Amazon ECS tasks and container instances. The old resource ID format was 36 characters long. The new IDs are in a 32-character format that does not include any hyphens. For information about opting in to the new resource ID format, see Modifying account settings (p. 199).

ARN and resource ID format timeline
There is a timeline for the opt-in and opt-out periods for the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format for Amazon ECS resources. The ARN and resource ID is set at the time of creation and does not change after that. Therefore, opting in or out of the new format does not affect the ARN or resource ID of your existing resources.
The following are the important dates related to this change.
· From now until September 30, 2020 ­ The ability to opt in to and opt out of the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource IDs is provided on a per-Region basis. Any new accounts created are opted out by default.
· October 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021 ­ All new accounts are opted in to the new format by default. Any existing accounts that have not explicitly opted out of the new format are also opted in. The ability to opt in and opt out continues to be available on a per-Region basis.
· April 1, 2021 ­ All accounts will be opted in by default. All new resources created will receive the new format. The ability to opt out will no longer be available.
You can modify your opt-in setting for the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format at any time between now and April 1, 2021. After you have opted in, any new resources that you create use the new format.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate
Scheduling Amazon ECS tasks
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a shared state, optimistic concurrency system that provides flexible scheduling capabilities for your tasks and containers. The Amazon ECS schedulers use the same cluster state information as the Amazon ECS API to make appropriate placement decisions.
Each task that uses the Fargate launch type has its own isolation boundary and doesn't share underlying resources with any other tasks. These resources include the underlying kernel, CPU resources, memory resources, and elastic network interface.
Amazon ECS provides a service scheduler for long-running tasks and applications. It also provides the ability to run tasks manually for batch jobs or single run tasks. Amazon ECS provides one whenever it places tasks on your cluster. You can specify the task placement strategies and constraints for running tasks that best meet your needs. For example, you can specify whether tasks run across multiple Availability Zones or within a single Availability Zone. And, optionally, you can integrate tasks with your own custom or third-party schedulers.
Service scheduler
The service scheduler is suitable for long running stateless services and applications. The service scheduler ensures that the scheduling strategy that you specify is followed and reschedules tasks when a task fails. For example, if the underlying infrastructure fails, the service scheduler can reschedule tasks.
There are two service scheduler strategies available:
· REPLICA--The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Replica (p. 213).
· DAEMON--The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, there is no need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Daemon in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Note Fargate tasks do not support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.
The service scheduler optionally also makes sure that tasks are registered against an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer. You can update your services that are maintained by the service scheduler. This might include deploying a new task definition or changing the number of desired tasks that are running. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across multiple Availability Zones. However, you can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Amazon ECS services (p. 212).
Manually running tasks
The RunTask action is suitable for processes such as batch jobs that perform work and then stop. For example, you can have a process call RunTask when work comes into a queue. The task pulls work from the queue, performs the work, and then exits. Using RunTask, you can allow the default task placement strategy to distribute tasks randomly across your cluster. This minimizes the chances that a single instance gets a disproportionate number of tasks. Alternatively, you can use RunTask to customize how the scheduler places tasks using task placement strategies and constraints. For more information, see Run a standalone task (p. 202) and RunTask in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference.
Running tasks on a cron-like schedule
201

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Run a standalone task
If you have tasks to run at set intervals in your cluster, you can use the Amazon ECS console to create an EventBridge event. You can run tasks for a backup operation or a log scan. The EventBridge event that you create can run one or more tasks in your cluster at specified times. Your scheduled event can be set to a specific interval (run every N minutes, hours, or days). Otherwise, for more complicated scheduling, you can use a cron expression. For more information, see Scheduled tasks (p. 204).
Contents · Run a standalone task (p. 202) · Scheduled tasks (p. 204) · AWS Fargate task maintenance (p. 208)
Run a standalone task
We recommend that you deploy your application as a standalone task in some situations. For example, suppose that you're developing an application but you're not ready to deploy it with the service scheduler. If your application is a one-time or periodic batch job, it doesn't make sense to keep running or restart when it finishes.
To deploy your application to run continually or to place it behind a load balancer, create an Amazon ECS service. For more information, see Amazon ECS services (p. 212).
Classic console
To run a standalone task using the classic console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions and select the task definition to run.
· To run the latest revision of a task definition, select the box to the left of the task definition to run.
· To run an earlier revision of a task definition, select the task definition to view all active revisions. Last, select the revision to run.
3. Choose Actions, Run Task. 4. On the Run Task page, complete the following steps.
a. Choose either a capacity provider strategy or a launch type.
· To use a Capacity provider strategy and choose Switch to capacity provider strategy. Then, choose whether your task uses the default capacity provider strategy that's defined for the cluster or a custom capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a custom capacity provider strategy. For more information, see Amazon ECS capacity providers (p. 78).
· To use a Launch type, choose Switch to launch type and select either EC2 or EXTERNAL. For more information about launch types, see Amazon ECS launch types (p. 124).
b. For Operating system family, choose the container operating system that the task runs on.. c. For Cluster, choose the cluster to use. d. For Number of tasks, enter the number of tasks to launch with this task definition. e. For Task group, enter the name of the task group. 5. If your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, complete these substeps. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
a. For Cluster VPC, choose the VPC that your container instances reside in. b. For Subnets, choose the available subnets for your task.
202

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Run a standalone task
Important Only private subnets are supported for the awsvpc network mode. Tasks don't receive public IP addresses. Therefore, a NAT gateway is required for outbound internet access, and inbound internet traffic is routed through a load balancer. c. For Security groups, a security group was created for your task that allows HTTP traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). To edit the name or the rules of this security group, choose Edit and then modify your security group settings. Do the same if you want to choose an existing security group. 6. (Optional) To send command, environment variable, task IAM role, or task execution role overrides to one or more containers in your task definition, choose Advanced Options and complete the following steps:
Note If you intend to use the parameter values from your task definition, you don't need to specify overrides. These fields are only used to override the values that are specified in the task definition.
a. For Task Role Override, choose an IAM role for this task to override the task IAM role that's specified in the task definition. For more information, see IAM roles for tasks (p. 360).
Only roles with the ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com trust relationship are displayed. For instructions on how to create an IAM role for your tasks, see Creating an IAM role and policy for your tasks (p. 361). b. For Task Execution Role Override, choose a task execution role to override the task execution role specified in the task definition. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354). c. For Container Overrides, choose a container to which to send a command or environment variable override.
· For a command override: For Command override, enter the command override to send. If your container definition doesn't specify an ENTRYPOINT, the format is a commaseparated list of non-quoted strings.
/bin/sh,-c,echo,$DATE
If your container definition specifies an ENTRYPOINT (such as sh,-c), enter a string value for your environment value (without the surrounding double quotation marks (" ")). AWS surrounds the strings with double quotation marks (" ") and passes the string as an argument to the ENTRYPOINT command.
while true; do echo $DATE > /var/www/html/index.html; sleep 1; done
· For environment variable overrides: Choose Add Environment Variable. For Key, enter the name of your environment variable. For Value, enter a string value for your environment value (without the surrounding double quotation marks (" ")).
AWS surrounds the strings with double quotation marks (" ") and passes the string to the container in the following format:
MY_ENV_VAR="This variable contains a string."
7. In the Task tagging configuration section, complete the following steps:
a. Select Enable ECS managed tags if you want Amazon ECS to automatically tag each task with the Amazon ECS managed tags. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources.
203

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Scheduled tasks
b. For Propagate tags from, select one of the following:
· Do not propagate ­ This option will not propagate any tags. · Task Definitions ­ This option will propagate the tags specified in the task definition to
the task. Note If you specify a tag with the same key in the Tags section, it will override the tag propagated from the task definition.
8. In the Tags section, specify the key and value for each tag to associate with the task. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources.
9. Review your task information and choose Run Task. Note If your task moves from the PENDING to the STOPPED status, your task might be stopping because of an error. This is also the case if it displays a PENDING status and then disappears from the listed tasks. For more information, see Checking stopped tasks for errors (p. 442) in the troubleshooting section.
Command line
Use the run-task command. For more information, see run-task in the AWS Command Line Interface Reference.
Scheduled tasks
Amazon ECS supports creating scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks use Amazon EventBridge rules to run tasks either on a schedule or in a response to an EventBridge event.
If you want to run tasks at set intervals, such as a backup operation or a log scan, you can create a scheduled task that runs one or more tasks at specified times. You can specify a regular interval (run every N minutes, hours, or days), or for more complicated scheduling, you can use a cron expression. For more information, see Cron expressions and rate expressions in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
If you want to run tasks that are triggered by an event, there are AWS managed events for services (for example Amazon ECS task and container instance state change events) or you can create a custom event pattern. For more information, see Event patterns in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.

AWS Fargate task maintenance
When AWS determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task hosted on AWS Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them.
For tasks that are part of an Amazon ECS service, if there's an issue with the underlying host, AWS stops the task. Moreover, the service scheduler also launches a new task in an attempt to maintain the desired
208

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task maintenance
count for the service. When this occurs, no task retirement notice is sent. However, if there's a security issue with the underlying host or platform version that the task is using, a task retirement notice is sent to your AWS Health Dashboard. The notice is also sent to the email address that's associated with the account. The task retirement notice provides details about the issue, the task retirement date, and what the next steps are. For more information, see Understanding the task retirement notice (p. 210).
For standalone tasks, when there's an issue with the underlying host or a security issue with the platform version that the task is using, AWS sends a task retirement notice to your AWS Health Dashboard. The notice also is sent to the email address associated with the account. The task retirement notice provides details about the issue, the task retirement date, and what the next steps are. For more information, see Understanding the task retirement notice (p. 210).
When a task is stopped in any of the scenarios mentioned here, you can describe the stopped task to retrieve the stoppedReason value. The stoppedReason containing a ECS is performing maintenance on the underlying infrastructure hosting the task message indicates that the task was stopped due to a task maintenance issue.
Important To prepare for the task retirement process, we recommend that you test your application behavior by simulating this scenario. You can do this by stopping an individual task in your service to test for resiliency.
The following table describes these scenarios.

209

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Understanding the task retirement notice
Understanding the task retirement notice
When a task retirement notice is sent, you're notified by email of the pending retirement. An email is sent before the event with the task ID and retirement date. This email is sent to the address that's associated with your account. This is the same email address that you use to log in to the AWS Management Console. If you use an email account that you don't check regularly, you can use the AWS Health Dashboard to determine if any of your tasks are scheduled for retirement. You can update the contact information for your account on the Account Settings page.
When a task reaches its scheduled retirement date, it's stopped or terminated by AWS. This is if it hasn't already been stopped. For service tasks, the service scheduler launches a new task to replace the retired task, and then stops the task that will be retired. The service scheduler maintains the service's desired count. For standalone tasks, they're stopped and you're responsible for launching a replacement.
Working with tasks scheduled for retirement
Note This procedure only applies to service tasks. For standalone tasks, simply stop and run new standalone tasks.
To update your service tasks before the retirement date, you can use the following steps. For more information, see Updating a service (p. 237).
To update a running service (AWS Management Console)
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. On the navigation bar, select the Region that your cluster is in. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 4. On the Clusters page, select the name of the cluster where your service resides. 5. On the Cluster: name page, choose Services. 6. Check the box to the left of the service to update and choose Update. 7. On the Configure service page, your service information is pre-populated. Select Force new
deployment and choose Next step. Note When you force a new deployment, the scheduler launches new tasks using the patched platform version. Your tasks don't require you select a different platform version in order to update. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
8. On the Configure network and Set Auto Scaling (optional) pages, choose Next step. 9. Choose Update Service to finish and update your service.
To update a running service (AWS CLI)
1. Obtain the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the service.
aws ecs list-services --cluster cluster_name --region region
The output is as follows.
{ "serviceArns": [ "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/MyService" ]
}

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service scheduler concepts
Amazon ECS services
You can use an Amazon ECS service to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster. If one of your tasks fails or stops, the Amazon ECS service scheduler launches another instance of your task definition to replace it. This helps maintain your desired number of tasks in the service.
You can also optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.

Service scheduler concepts
We recommend that you use the service scheduler for long running stateless services and applications. The service scheduler ensures that the scheduling strategy that you specify is followed and reschedules tasks when a task fails. For example, if the underlying infrastructure fails, the service scheduler reschedules a task. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize how the scheduler places and terminates tasks. If a task in a service stops, the scheduler launches a new task to replace it. This process continues until your service reaches your desired number of tasks based on the scheduling strategy that the service uses. The scheduling strategy of the service is also referred to as the service type.
The service scheduler includes logic that throttles how often tasks are restarted if tasks repeatedly fail to start. If a task is stopped without having entered a RUNNING state, the service scheduler starts to slow down the launch attempts and sends out a service event message. This behavior prevents unnecessary resources from being used for failed tasks before you can resolve the issue. After the service is updated, the service scheduler resumes normal scheduling behavior. For more information, see Service throttle logic (p. 274) and Service event messages (p. 450).
There are two service scheduler strategies available:
· REPLICA--The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Replica (p. 213).
212

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Replica
· DAEMON--The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, there is no need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Daemon in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Note Fargate tasks do not support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.
Replica
The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks in your cluster.
For a service that runs tasks on Fargate, when the service scheduler launches new tasks or stops running tasks, the service scheduler attempts to maintain a balance across Availability Zones. You don't need to specify task placement strategies or restraints.
Additional service concepts
· You can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. For more information, see Service load balancing (p. 252).
· You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. A deployment is triggered by updating the task definition or desired count of a service. During a deployment, the service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters to determine the deployment strategy. For more information, see Service definition parameters (p. 213).
· You can optionally configure your service to use Amazon ECS service discovery. Service discovery uses the AWS Cloud Map autonaming APIs to manage DNS entries for your service's tasks. This makes them discoverable from within your VPC. For more information, see Service Discovery (p. 271).
· When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service moves from an ACTIVE to a DRAINING status, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either a STOPPING or STOPPED status, the service moves from a DRAINING to INACTIVE status. You can view services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status by using the DescribeServices API operation. However, in the future, INACTIVE services might be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and DescribeServices calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error.
Service definition parameters
A service definition defines how to run your Amazon ECS service. The following parameters can be specified in a service definition.
Launch type
launchType
Type: String
Valid values: EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL
Required: No
213

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Capacity provider strategy
The launch type on which to run your service. If a launch type is not specified, EC2 is used by default. For more information, see Amazon ECS launch types (p. 124).
If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be omitted.
Capacity provider strategy
capacityProviderStrategy
Type: Array of objects
Required: No
The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.
A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used.
If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter must be omitted. If no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is specified, the defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used.
If you want to specify a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.
To use an AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.
The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created. capacityProvider
Type: String
Required: Yes
The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the capacity provider. weight
Type: Integer
Valid range: Integers between 0 and 1,000.
Required: No
The weight value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that use the specified capacity provider.
For example, assume that you have a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of one. When the base is satisfied, the tasks split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, assume that you specify a weight of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capacityProviderB. Then, for every one task that is run using capacityProviderA, four tasks use capacityProviderB.
214

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task definition
base Type: Integer Valid range: Integers between 0 and 100,000. Required: No The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.
Task definition
taskDefinition Type: String Required: No The family and revision (family:revision) or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task definition to run in your service. If a revision isn't specified, the latest ACTIVE revision of the specified family is used. A task definition must be specified when using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller.
Platform operating system
platformFamily Type: string Required: Conditional Default: Linux This parameter is required for Amazon ECS services hosted on Fargate. This parameter is ignored for Amazon ECS services hosted onAmazon EC2. The operating system on the containers that runs the service. The valid values are LINUX, WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL, and WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE. The platformFamily value for every task that you specify for the service must match the service platformFamily value. For example, if you set the platformFamily to WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL, the platformFamily value for all the tasks must be WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL.
Platform version
platformVersion Type: String Required: No
215

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Cluster
The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the latest version (LATEST) is used by default.
AWS Fargate platform versions are used to refer to a specific runtime environment for the Fargate task infrastructure. When specifying the LATEST platform version when running a task or creating a service, you get the most current platform version available for your tasks. When you scale up your service, those tasks receive the platform version that was specified on the service's current deployment. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
Cluster
cluster Type: String
Required: No
The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your service. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
Service name
serviceName Type: String
Required: Yes
The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.
Scheduling strategy
schedulingStrategy Type: String
Valid values: REPLICA Required: No
The scheduling strategy to use. If no scheduling strategy is specified, the REPLICA strategy is used. For more information, see Service scheduler concepts (p. 212).
There are two service scheduler strategies available: · REPLICA--The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks
across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Replica (p. 213). · DAEMON--The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, there is no need to specify
216

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Desired count
a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Daemon in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Note Fargate tasks do not support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.
Desired count
desiredCount
Type: Integer
Required: No
The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running on your cluster.
This parameter is required if the REPLICA scheduling strategy is used. If the service uses the DAEMON scheduling strategy, this parameter is optional.
Deployment configuration
deploymentConfiguration
Type: Object
Required: No
Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks. maximumPercent
Type: Integer
Required: No
If a service is using the rolling update (ECS) deployment type, the maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. It is expressed as a percentage of the desiredCount that is rounded down to the nearest integer. You can use this parameter to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the REPLICA service scheduler and has a desiredCount of four tasks and a maximumPercent value of 200%, the scheduler might start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks. This is provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. The default maximumPercent value for a service using the REPLICA service scheduler is 200%.
If your service is using the DAEMON service scheduler type, the maximumPercent should remain at 100%. This is the default value.
The maximum number of tasks during a deployment is the desiredCount multiplied by the maximumPercent/100, rounded down to the nearest integer value.
If a service is using either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) or EXTERNAL deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the maximum percent value is set to the default value and is used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value isn't used, although it's returned when describing your service.
217

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Deployment controller
minimumHealthyPercent
Type: Integer
Required: No
If a service is using the rolling update (ECS) deployment type, the minimumHealthyPercent represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. This is expressed as a percentage of the desiredCount that is rounded up to the nearest integer. You can use this parameter to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desiredCount of four tasks and a minimumHealthyPercent of 50%, the service scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks.
For services that do not use a load balancer, consider the following: · A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks in the service pass
their health checks. · If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler waits
for 40 seconds after a task reaches a RUNNING state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total. · If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler waits for the task to reach a healthy status before counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by the container health check settings. For more information, see Health check (p. 104).
For services that do use a load balancer, consider the following: · If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler waits
for the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total. · If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service scheduler waits for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.
The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default minimumHealthyPercent value for a service using the DAEMON service schedule is 0% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the AWS Management Console.
The minimum number of healthy tasks during a deployment is the desiredCount multiplied by the minimumHealthyPercent/100, rounded up to the nearest integer value.
If a service is using either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) or EXTERNAL deployment types and is running tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent value is set to the default value and is used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If a service is using either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) or EXTERNAL deployment types and is running tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent value is not used, although it is returned when describing your service.
Deployment controller
deploymentController
Type: Object
218

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task placement
Required: No
The deployment controller to use for the service. If no deployment controller is specified, the ECS controller is used. For more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment types (p. 240). type
Type: String
Valid values: ECS | CODE_DEPLOY | EXTERNAL
Required: yes
The deployment controller type to use. There are three deployment controller types available: ECS
The rolling update (ECS) deployment type involves replacing the current running version of the container with the latest version. The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by adjusting the minimum and maximum number of healthy tasks allowed during a service deployment, as specified in the deploymentConfiguration. CODE_DEPLOY
The blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment type uses the blue/green deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which allows you to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it. EXTERNAL
The external deployment type enables you to use any third-party deployment controller for full control over the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service.
Task placement
placementStrategy
Type: Array of objects
Required: No
The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of four strategy rules per service. type
Type: String
Valid values: random | spread | binpack
Required: No
The type of placement strategy. The random placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The spread placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the field parameter. The binpack strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that's specified with the field parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory but still enough to run the task. field
Type: String

Network configuration
networkConfiguration Type: Object
Required: No
The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it isn't supported for other network modes. If using the Fargate launch type, the awsvpc network mode is required. For more information, see Fargate Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.. awsvpcConfiguration
Type: Object
Required: No
An object representing the subnets and security groups for a task or service. subnets
Type: Array of strings
Required: Yes
The subnets that are associated with the task or service. There is a limit of 16 subnets that can be specified according to awsvpcConfiguration. securityGroups Type: Array of strings
Required: No
The security groups associated with the task or service. If you don't specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is used. There's a limit of five security groups that can be specified based on awsvpcConfiguration. assignPublicIP Type: String
Valid values: ENABLED | DISABLED Required: No
Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a public IP address. If no value is specified, the default value of DISABLED is used. healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds Type: Integer
221

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Network configuration
Required: No
The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks, container health checks, and Route 53 health checks after a task enters a RUNNING state. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you do not specify a health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used.
If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores the health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use the startPeriod in the task definition health check parameters. For more information, see Health check. loadBalancers
Type: Array of objects
Required: No
A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your service. For services that use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, there's a limit of five target groups that you can attach to a service.
After you create a service, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable.
For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified.
For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified. targetGroupArn
Type: String
Required: No
The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target group that's associated with a service.
A target group ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN. loadBalancerName
Type: String
Required: No
The name of the load balancer to associate with the service.
A load balancer name is only specified when using a Classic Load Balancer. If you're using an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer, omit the load balancer name parameter.

Creating an Amazon ECS service
When you create an Amazon ECS service, you specify the parameters that define what makes up your service and how your service behaves. These parameters create a service definition. For more information, see Service definition parameters (p. 213).
For services that are hosted on Fargate or Amazon EC2 instances, you can optionally configure an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to distribute traffic across the containers in your service. For more information, see Service load balancing (p. 252).
Note When using a load balancer with services that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, verify that your instances can receive traffic from your load balancers. You can allow traffic to all ports on your instances from your load balancer's security group. This ensures that traffic can reach any containers that use dynamically assigned ports.
Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
Important Amazon ECS has provided a new console experience for creating a service. For more information, see Creating a service using the new console (p. 72). If you're creating a Windows service for the Fargate launch type, you must use the classic console.
The Amazon ECS console provides a create service wizard that guides you through each step to create a service. Use the following pages explain each step in more detail.
Topics · Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226) · Step 2: Configure a network (p. 228) · Step 3: Configuring your service to use a load balancer (p. 229) · Step 4: Configuring your service to use Service Discovery (p. 233) · Step 5: Configuring your service to use Service Auto Scaling (p. 234) · Step 6: Review and create your service (p. 236)
Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters
Important Amazon ECS has provided a new console experience for creating a service. For more information, see Creating a service using the new console (p. 72).
All services require some configuration parameters that define the service, such as the task definition to use, which cluster that the service runs on, how many tasks are placed for the service. This is called the service definition. For more information about the parameters defined in a service definition, see Service definition parameters (p. 213).
This procedure covers how to create a service and covers the service definition parameters that are required. After you configured these parameters, you can create your service or move on to the procedures for optional service definition configuration. For example, you can move on to configuring your service to use a load balancer.
Note If your cluster is configured with a default capacity provider strategy, you can only create a service using the default capacity provider strategy when using the console. Likewise, if no
226

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
default capacity provider is defined, you can only use a launch type when creating a service using the console. It's not currently possible to have a mixed strategy using both capacity providers and launch types in the console.
To configure the basic service definition parameters
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
2. On the navigation bar, select the Region that your cluster is in.
3. In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions and select the task definition to create your service from.
4. On the Task Definition name page, select the revision of the task definition to create your service from.
5. Review the task definition, and choose Actions, Create Service.
6. On the Configure service page, complete the following steps.
a. Choose either a capacity provider strategy or a launch type.
· To use a Capacity provider strategy, first choose Switch to capacity provider strategy. Next, choose whether your service uses the default capacity provider strategy that's defined for the cluster or a custom capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider must already be associated with the cluster to be used in a custom capacity provider strategy. For more information, see Amazon ECS capacity providers (p. 78).
· To use a Launch type, choose Switch to launch type and select FARGATE, EC2, or EXTERNAL. For more information about launch types, see Amazon ECS launch types (p. 124).
b. For Platform operating system, if you chose the Fargate launch type, then select the platform operating system (for example, LINUX).
c. For Platform version, if you chose a Fargate capacity provider or the Fargate launch type, then select the platform version to use.
Note When the LATEST platform version is selected, we validate the operating system that was specified for the task, and then set the appropriate platform version. If the Operating System is set to Windows-Server-2019-Full or WindowsServer-2019-Core, the 1.0.0 platform is used. If the operating system is Linux, the 1.4.0 platform version is used. d. Cluster: Select the cluster to create your service in.
e. Service name: Type a name for your service. It must be unique.
f. Service type: Select a scheduling strategy for your service. For more information, see Service scheduler concepts (p. 212).
g. Number of tasks: If you chose the REPLICA service type, enter the number of tasks to launch and maintain on your cluster.
Note If your launch type is EC2 and your task definition uses static host port mappings on your container instances, then you need at least one container instance with the specified port available in your cluster for each task in your service. This restriction doesn't apply if your task definition uses dynamic host port mappings with the bridge network mode. For more information, see portMappings (p. 102).
h. If you're using the Rolling update deployment type, fill out the following deployment configuration parameters. For more information about how these parameters are used, see Deployment configuration (p. 217).
· Minimum healthy percent: Specify a lower limit for the number of tasks that your service must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. Specify the number as a percentage of the desired number of tasks. This number must be a whole number.
227

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
· Maximum percent: Specify an upper limit for the number of tasks that your service allows in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. Specify the number as a percentage of the desired number of tasks. This number must be a whole number.
7. For Deployment circuit breaker, choose the deployment circuit breaker logic. For more information, see the section called "Using the deployment circuit breaker" (p. 241).
8. On the Deployments page, complete the following steps.
a. For Deployment type, choose whether your service uses a rolling update deployment or a blue/ green deployment using AWS CodeDeploy. For more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment types (p. 240).
b. If you selected the blue/green deployment type, complete the following steps:
i. For Deployment configuration choose the deployment configuration to use for the service. This determines how traffic is shifted when your task set is updated. For more information, see Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy (p. 243)
ii. For Service role for CodeDeploy choose the IAM service role for AWS CodeDeploy. For more information, see Amazon ECS CodeDeploy IAM Role (p. 365)
9. In the Task tagging configuration section, complete the following steps:
a. Select Enable ECS managed tags if you want Amazon ECS to automatically tag the tasks in the service with the Amazon ECS managed tags. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources.
b. For Propagate tags from, select one of the following:
· Do not propagate ­ This option will not propagate any tags to the tasks in the service. · Service ­ This option will propagate the tags specified on your service to each of the tasks in
the service. · Task Definitions ­ This option will propagate the tags specified in the task definition of a task
to the tasks in the service.
Note If you specify a tag with the same key in the Tags section, it will override the tag propagated from either the service or the task definition. 10. In the Tags section, specify the key and value for each tag to associate with the task. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources. 11. Choose Next step and navigate to Step 2: Configure a network (p. 228).
Step 2: Configure a network
Important Amazon ECS has a new console experience for creating a service. For more information, see Creating a service using the new console (p. 72).
If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, you must configure a VPC, subnet, and security group for your service.
If your service's task definition uses the bridge, host, or none network modes, you can move on to the next step, Step 3: Configuring your service to use a load balancer (p. 229).
For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the awsvpc network mode doesn't provide task ENIs with public IP addresses. To access the internet, tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances can be launched in a private subnet that's configured to use a NAT gateway. For more information, see NAT Gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide. Inbound network access must be from within the VPC using the
228

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
private IP address or DNS hostname, or routed through a load balancer from within the VPC. Tasks that are launched within public subnets don't have internet access.
To configure VPC and security group settings for your service
1. If you didn't do so already, follow the basic service configuration procedures in Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226).
2. For Cluster VPC, if you're hosting tasks on Amazon EC2 instances, choose the VPC that your instances are in. If you're hosting tasks on Fargate, select the VPC that the Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks use. Ensure that the VPC that you choose isn't configured to require dedicated hardware tenancy. This feature isn't supported by Fargate.
3. For Subnets, choose the available subnets for your service task placement. 4. For Security groups, a security group was created for your service's tasks. This security group allows
HTTP traffic access from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). To edit the name or the rules of this security group or to choose an existing security group, choose Edit and then modify your security group settings. 5. For Auto-assign Public IP, choose whether to have your tasks receive a public IP address. For tasks on Fargate, for the task to pull the container image, it must either use a public subnet and be assigned a public IP address or a private subnet that has a route to the internet or a NAT gateway that can route requests to the internet. 6. If you're configuring your service to use a load balancer or if you're using the blue/green deployment type, continue to Step 3: Configuring your service to use a load balancer (p. 229). If you aren't configuring your service to use a load balancer, you can choose None as the load balancer type and move on to the next section, Step 5: Configuring your service to use Service Auto Scaling (p. 234).
Step 3: Configuring your service to use a load balancer
Important Amazon ECS has a new console experience for creating a service. For more information, see Creating a service using the new console (p. 72).
Services can be configured to use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic to the tasks in your service. If your service is using the rolling update deployment type, this is optional. If your service is using the blue/green deployment type, then it is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer.
If you aren't configuring your service to use a load balancer, you can choose None as the load balancer type and move on to the next section, Step 4: Configuring your service to use Service Discovery (p. 233).
If you configured an available Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, you can attach it to your service with the following procedures, or you can configure a new load balancer. For more information, see Creating a load balancer (p. 256).
Important Before following these procedures, you must create your Elastic Load Balancing load balancer resources.
Topics · Configuring a load balancer for the rolling update deployment type (p. 229) · Configuring a load balancer for the blue/green deployment type (p. 231)
Configuring a load balancer for the rolling update deployment type
If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 68 years). During that time,
229

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
the service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer.
To configure a health check grace period
1. If you didn't do so already, follow the basic service configuration procedures in Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226).
2. For Health check grace period: Enter the period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started.
To configure your service to use a load balancer, you must choose the load balancer type to use with your service.
To choose a load balancer type
1. If you didn't do so already, follow the basic service creation procedures in Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226).
2. For Load balancer type, choose the load balancer type to use with your service:
Application Load Balancer
Allows containers to use dynamic host port mapping. With host port mapping allowed, you can place multiple tasks using the same port on a single container instance. Multiple services can use the same listener port on a single load balancer with rule-based routing and paths. Network Load Balancer
Allows containers to use dynamic host port mapping. With host port mapping allowed, you can place multiple tasks using the same port on a single container instance. Multiple services can use the same listener port on a single load balancer with rule-based routing. Classic Load Balancer
Requires static host port mappings (only one task allowed per container instance). Rule-based routing and paths aren't supported.
We recommend that you use Application Load Balancers for your Amazon ECS services. That way, you can use the advanced features of Application Load Balancer. 3. For Select IAM role for service, choose Create new role to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role or select your existing service-linked role. 4. For ELB Name, choose the name of the load balancer to use with your service. Only load balancers that correspond to the load balancer type that you selected earlier are visible here. 5. The next step depends on the load balancer type for your service. If you've chosen an Application Load Balancer, follow the steps in To configure an Application Load Balancer (p. 230). If you've chosen a Network Load Balancer, follow the steps in To configure a Network Load Balancer (p. 231).
To configure an Application Load Balancer
1. For Container to load balance, choose the container and port combination from your task definition that your load balancer distributes traffic to, and choose Add to load balancer.
2. For Listener port, choose the listener port and protocol of the listener that you created in Creating an Application Load Balancer (p. 256) (if applicable). Alternatively, choose create new to create a new listener and then enter a port number and choose a port protocol for Listener protocol.
230

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
3. For Target group name, choose the target group that you created in Creating an Application Load Balancer (p. 256) (if applicable), or choose create new to create a new target group.
Important If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), your target group must use ip as the target type, not instance. This is because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. 4. (Optional) If you chose to create a new target group, complete the following fields as follows:
· For Target group name, a default name is provided for you. · For Target group protocol, enter the protocol to use for routing traffic to your tasks. · For Path pattern, if your listener doesn't have any existing rules, the default path pattern (/) is
used. If your listener already has a default rule, then you must enter a path pattern that matches traffic that you want to have sent to your service's target group. For example, if your service is a web application called web-app, and you want traffic that matches http://my-elb-url/webapp to route to your service, then enter /web-app* as your path pattern. For more information, see ListenerRules in the User Guide for Application Load Balancers. · For Health check path, enter the path that the load balancer sends health check pings to. 5. When you're finished configuring your Application Load Balancer, choose Next step.
To configure a Network Load Balancer
1. For Container to load balance, choose the container and port combination from your task definition that your load balancer should distribute traffic to, and choose Add to load balancer.

3. For Target group name, choose the target group that you created in Creating a Network Load Balancer (p. 259) (if applicable), or choose create new to create a new target group.
Important If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), your target group must use ip as the target type, not instance. This is because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. 4. (Optional) If you chose to create a new target group, complete the following fields as follows:
· For Target group name, a default name is provided for you. · For Target group protocol, enter the protocol to use for routing traffic to your tasks. · For Health check path, enter the path that the load balancer sends health check pings to. 5. When you're finished configuring your Network Load Balancer, choose Next Step.
Configuring a load balancer for the blue/green deployment type
To configure your service that uses the blue/green deployment type to use a load balancer, you must use either an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer.
To choose a load balancer type
1. If you didn't do so already, follow the procedures to create the service in Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226).
2. For Load balancer type, choose the load balancer type to use with your service:
231

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console

Allows containers to use dynamic host port mapping. With host port mapping, you can place multiple tasks using the same port on a single container instance. Multiple services can use the same listener port on a single load balancer with rule-based routing.
We recommend that you use Application Load Balancers for your Amazon ECS services. That way, you can use all of the Application Load Balancer features. 3. For Load balancer name, choose the name of the load balancer to use with your service. Only load balancers that correspond to the load balancer type that you selected earlier are visible here. 4. The next step depends on the load balancer type for your service. If you chose an Application Load Balancer, follow the steps in To configure an Application Load Balancer (p. 230). If you chose a Network Load Balancer, follow the steps in To configure a Network Load Balancer (p. 231).
To configure an Application Load Balancer for the blue/green deployment type
1. For Container to load balance, choose the container and port combination from your task definition that your load balancer distributes traffic to, and choose Add to load balancer.
2. For Production listener port, choose the listener port and protocol of the listener that you created in Creating an Application Load Balancer (p. 256) (if applicable), or choose create new to create a new listener and then enter a port number and choose a port protocol for Production listener protocol.
3. (Optional) Select Test listener if you want to configure a listener port and protocol on your load balancer to test updates to your service before routing traffic to your new task set. Complete the following step:
· For Test listener port, choose the listener port and protocol of the listener that you want to test traffic over, or choose create new to create a new test listener and then enter a port number and choose a port protocol in Test listener protocol.
4. For blue/green deployments, two target groups are required. Each target group binds to a separate task set in the deployment. Complete the following steps:
a. For Target group 1 name, choose the target group that you created in Creating an Application Load Balancer (p. 256) (if applicable), or choose create new to create a new target group.
Important If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), your target group must use ip as the target type, not instance. This is because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. b. (Optional) If you chose to create a new target group, complete the following fields as follows:
· For Target group name, enter a name for your target group. · For Target group protocol, enter the protocol to use for routing traffic to your tasks. · For Path pattern, if your listener does not have any existing rules, the default path pattern
(/) is used. If your listener already has a default rule, then you must enter a path pattern that matches traffic that you want to have sent to your service's target group. For example, if your service is a web application called web-app, and you want traffic that matches http://myelb-url/web-app to route to your service, then you would enter /web-app* as your

· For Target group name, enter a name for your target group. · For Target group protocol, enter the protocol to use for routing traffic to your tasks. · For Health check path, enter the path to which the load balancer should send health check pings. 5. When you are finished configuring your Network Load Balancer, choose Next Step. Navigate to Step 4: Configuring your service to use Service Discovery (p. 233).
Step 4: Configuring your service to use Service Discovery
Your Amazon ECS service can optionally use service discovery integration, which allows your service to be discoverable via DNS. For more information, see Service Discovery (p. 271).
If you are not configuring your service to use a service discovery, you can move on to the next section, Step 5: Configuring your service to use Service Auto Scaling (p. 234).
To configure service discovery
1. If you have not done so already, follow the basic service configuration procedures in Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226).
2. On the Configure network page, select Enable service discovery integration. 3. For Namespace, select an existing Amazon Route 53 namespace, if you have one, otherwise select
create new private namespace. 4. If creating a new namespace, for Namespace name enter a descriptive name for your namespace.
This is the name used for the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone. 5. For Configure service discovery service, select to either create a new service discovery service or
select an existing one. 6. If creating a new service discovery service, for Service discovery name enter a descriptive name for
your service discovery service. This is used as the prefix for the DNS records to be created.
233

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
7. Select Enable ECS task health propagation if you want health checks enabled for your service discovery service.
8. For DNS record type, select the DNS record type to create for your service. Amazon ECS service discovery only supports A and SRV records, depending on the network mode that your task definition specifies. For more information about these record types, see Supported DNS Record Types in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
· If the task definition that your service task specifies uses the bridge or host network mode, only type SRV records are supported. Choose a container name and port combination to associate with the record.
· If the task definition that your service task specifies uses the awsvpc network mode, select either the A or SRV record type. If the type A DNS record is selected, skip to the next step. If the type SRV is selected, specify either the port that the service can be found on or a container name and port combination to associate with the record.
9. For TTL, enter the resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. This value determines how long a record set is cached by DNS resolvers and by web browsers.
10. Choose Next step to proceed and navigate to Step 5: Configuring your service to use Service Auto Scaling (p. 234).
Step 5: Configuring your service to use Service Auto Scaling
Your Amazon ECS service can optionally be configured to use Auto Scaling to adjust its desired count of tasks in your Amazon ECS service up or down in response to CloudWatch alarms.
Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling supports the following types of scaling policies:
· Target tracking scaling policies (p. 265) (Recommended)--Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on a target value for a specific metric. This is similar to the way that your thermostat maintains the temperature of your home. You select temperature and the thermostat does the rest.
· Step scaling policies (p. 269)--Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, which vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
For more information, see Service auto scaling (p. 263).
To configure basic Service Auto Scaling parameters
1. If you have not done so already, follow the basic service configuration procedures in Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters (p. 226).
2. On the Set Auto Scaling page, select Configure Service Auto Scaling to adjust your service's desired count.
3. For Minimum number of tasks, enter the lower limit of the number of tasks for Service Auto Scaling to use. Your service's desired count is not automatically adjusted below this amount.
4. For Desired number of tasks, this field is pre-populated with the value that you entered earlier. You can change your service's desired count at this time, but this value must be between the minimum and maximum number of tasks specified on this page.
5. For Maximum number of tasks, enter the upper limit of the number of tasks for Service Auto Scaling to use. Your service's desired count is not automatically adjusted above this amount.
6. For IAM role for Service Auto Scaling, choose the ecsAutoscaleRole. If this role does not exist, choose Create new role to have the console create it for you.
7. The following procedures provide steps for creating either target tracking or step scaling policies for your service. Choose your desired scaling policy type.
234

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
These steps help you create target tracking scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms that can be used to trigger scaling activities for your service.
To configure target tracking scaling policies for your service
1. For Scaling policy type, choose Target tracking. 2. For Policy name, enter a descriptive name for your policy. 3. For ECS service metric, choose the metric to track. The following metrics are available:
· ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization--Average CPU utilization of the service. · ECSServiceAverageMemoryUtilization--Average memory utilization of the service. · ALBRequestCountPerTarget--Number of requests completed per target in an Application Load
Balancer target group. 4. For Target value, enter the metric value that the policy should maintain. For example, use
a target value of 1000 for ALBRequestCountPerTarget, or a target value of 75(%) for ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization. 5. For Scale-out cooldown period, enter the amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-out activity completes before another scale-out activity can start. While the scale-out cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous scale-out activity that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. 6. For Scale-in cooldown period, enter the amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes before another scale-in activity can start. The scale-in cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale out activity during the cooldown period after a scale-in, Service Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately. 7. (Optional) To turn off the scale-in actions for this policy, choose Disable scale-in. This allows you to create a separate scaling policy for scale-in later. 8. Choose Next step.
These steps help you create step scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms that can be used to trigger scaling activities for your service. You can create a Scale out alarm to increase the desired count of your service, and a Scale in alarm to decrease the desired count of your service.
To configure step scaling policies for your service
1. For Scaling policy type, choose Step scaling. 2. For Policy name, enter a descriptive name for your policy. 3. For Execute policy when, select the CloudWatch alarm to use to scale your service up or down.
You can use an existing CloudWatch alarm that you have previously created, or you can choose to create a new alarm. The Create new alarm workflow allows you to create CloudWatch alarms that are based on the CPUUtilization and MemoryUtilization of the service that you are creating. To use other metrics, you can create your alarm in the CloudWatch console and then return to this wizard to choose that alarm. 4. (Optional) If you've chosen to create a new alarm, complete the following steps.
a. For Alarm name, enter a descriptive name for your alarm. For example, if your alarm should trigger when your service CPU utilization exceeds 75%, you could call the alarm service_name-cpu-gt-75.
b. For ECS service metric, choose the service metric to use for your alarm. For more information, see Service auto scaling (p. 263).
235

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console
c. For Alarm threshold, enter the following information to configure your alarm:
· Choose the CloudWatch statistic for your alarm (the default value of Average works in many cases). For more information, see Statistics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
· Choose the comparison operator for your alarm and enter the value that the comparison operator checks against (for example, > and 75).
· Enter the number of consecutive periods before the alarm is triggered and the period length. For example, two consecutive periods of 5 minutes would take 10 minutes before the alarm triggered. Because your Amazon ECS tasks can scale up and down quickly, consider using a low number of consecutive periods and a short period duration to react to alarms as soon as possible.
d. Choose Save. 5. For Scaling action, enter the following information to configure how your service responds to the
alarm:
· Choose whether to add to, subtract from, or set a specific desired count for your service. · If you chose to add or subtract tasks, enter the number of tasks (or percent of existing tasks) to
add or subtract when the scaling action is triggered. If you chose to set the desired count, enter the desired count that your service should be set to when the scaling action is triggered. · (Optional) If you chose to add or subtract tasks, choose whether the previous value is used as an integer or a percent value of the existing desired count. · Enter the lower boundary of your step scaling adjustment. By default, for your first scaling action, this value is the metric amount where your alarm is triggered. For example, the following scaling action adds 100% of the existing desired count when the CPU utilization is greater than 75%.
6. (Optional) You can repeat Step 5 (p. 236) to configure multiple scaling actions for a single alarm (for example, to add one task if CPU utilization is between 75-85%, and to add two tasks if CPU utilization is greater than 85%).
7. (Optional) If you chose to add or subtract a percentage of the existing desired count, enter a minimum increment value for Add tasks in increments of N task(s).
8. For Cooldown period, enter the number of seconds between scaling actions. 9. Repeat Step 1 (p. 235) through Step 8 (p. 236) for the Scale in policy and choose Save. 10. Choose Next step to proceed and navigate to Step 6: Review and create your service (p. 236).
Step 6: Review and create your service
After you have configured your basic service definition parameters and optionally configured your service's networking, load balancer, service discovery, and automatic scaling, you can review your configuration. Then, choose Create Service to finish creating your service.
Note After you create a service, the target group ARN or load balancer name, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. You can use the AWS CLI or SDK to modify the load balancer configuration. For information about how to modify the configuration, see UpdateService in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference. You cannot add, remove, or change the load balancer configuration of an existing service. If you update the task definition for the service, the container name and container port that were specified when the service was created must remain in the task definition.
236

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Updating a service
Updating a service
You can update an existing service to change some of the service configuration parameters, such as the number of tasks that are maintained by a service, which task definition is used by the tasks, or if your tasks are using the Fargate launch type, you can change the platform version your service uses. A service using a Linux platform version can't be updated to use a Windows platform version and vice versa. If you have an application that needs more capacity, you can scale up your service. If you have unused capacity to scale down, you can reduce the number of desired tasks in your service and free up resources.
If you want to use an updated container image for your tasks, you can create a new task definition revision with that image and deploy it to your service by using the force new deployment option in the console.
The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the deployment configuration for the service) to determine the deployment strategy.
If a service is using the rolling update (ECS) deployment type, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). The parameter also applies while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.
If a service is using the rolling update (ECS) deployment type, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). The parameter also applies while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks. That's provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. The default value for the maximum percent is 200%.
If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment type and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are set to the default values. They are only used to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are not used. They are currently visible when describing your service.
When the service scheduler replaces a task during an update, the service first removes the task from the load balancer (if used) and waits for the connections to drain. Then, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM signal and a 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM signal gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL signal is sent. The service scheduler starts and stops tasks as defined by your minimum healthy percent and maximum percent settings.
Important If you are changing the ports used by containers in a task definition, you may need to update the security groups for the container instances to work with the updated ports. If your service uses a load balancer, the load balancer configuration defined for your service when it was created cannot be changed. If you update the task definition for the service, the
237

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Updating a service using the classic console
container name and container port that were specified when the service was created must remain in the task definition. To change the load balancer name, the container name, or the container port associated with a service load balancer configuration, you must create a new service. Amazon ECS does not automatically update the security groups associated with Elastic Load Balancing load balancers or Amazon ECS container instances.

Deleting a service
You can delete an Amazon ECS service using the console. Before deletion, the service is automatically scaled down to zero. If you have a load balancer or service discovery resources associated with the service, they are not affected by the service deletion. To delete your Elastic Load Balancing resources, see one of the following topics, depending on your load balancer type: Delete an Application Load Balancer or Delete a Network Load Balancer. To delete your service discovery resources, follow the procedure below.
Classic console
Use the following procedure to delete an Amazon ECS service.
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. On the navigation bar, select the Region that your cluster is in. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters and select the name of the cluster in which your service
resides. 4. On the Cluster : name page, choose Services. 5. Check the box to the left of the service to update and choose Delete. 6. Confirm the service deletion by entering the text phrase and choose Delete.
AWS CLI
To delete the remaining service discovery resources, you can use the AWS CLI to delete the service discovery service and service discovery namespace.
1. Ensure that the latest version of the AWS CLI is installed and configured. For more information about installing or upgrading your AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface.
2. Retrieve the ID of the service discovery service to delete.
aws servicediscovery list-services --region <region_name>
239

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Deployment types
Note If no service discovery service is returned, continue to step 4. 3. Using the service discovery service ID from the previous output, delete the service.
aws servicediscovery delete-service --id <service_discovery_service_id> -region <region_name>
4. Retrieve the ID of the service discovery namespace to delete.
aws servicediscovery list-namespaces --region <region_name>
5. Using the service discovery namespace ID from the previous output, delete the namespace.
aws servicediscovery delete-namespace --id <service_discovery_namespace_id> -region <region_name>
Amazon ECS Deployment types
An Amazon ECS deployment type determines the deployment strategy that your service uses. There are three deployment types: rolling update, blue/green, and external.
You can view information about the service deployment type on the service details page, or by using the describe-services API. For more information, see DescribeServices in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference.
Topics · Rolling update (p. 240) · Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy (p. 243) · External deployment (p. 247)
Rolling update
When the rolling update (ECS) deployment type is used for your service, when a new service deployment is started the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the deployment configuration. The deployment configuration consists of the minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent values which are defined when the service is created, but can also be updated on an existing service.
The minimumHealthyPercent represents the lower limit on the number of tasks that should be running for a service during a deployment or when a container instance is draining, as a percent of the desired number of tasks for the service. This value is rounded up. For example if the minimum healthy percent is 50 and the desired task count is four, then the scheduler can stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Likewise, if the minimum healthy percent is 75% and the desired task count is two, then the scheduler can't stop any tasks due to the resulting value also being two.
The maximumPercent represents the upper limit on the number of tasks that should be running for a service during a deployment or when a container instance is draining, as a percent of the desired number of tasks for a service. This value is rounded down. For example if the maximum percent is 200 and the desired task count is four then the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping four existing tasks. Likewise, if the maximum percent is 125 and the desired task count is three, the scheduler can't start any tasks due to the resulting value also being three.
240

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Rolling update
Important When setting a minimum healthy percent or a maximum percent, you should ensure that the scheduler can stop or start at least one task when a deployment is triggered. If your service has a deployment that is stuck due to an invalid deployment configuration, a service event message will be sent. For more information, see service (service-name) was unable to stop or start tasks during a deployment because of the service deployment configuration. Update the minimumHealthyPercent or maximumPercent value and try again. (p. 452).
When a new service deployment is started or when a deployment is completed, Amazon ECS sends a service deployment state change event to EventBridge. This provides a programmatic way to monitor the status of your service deployments. For more information, see Service deployment state change events (p. 304).
To create a new Amazon ECS service that uses the rolling update deployment type, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226).
Using the deployment circuit breaker
By default, when a service using the rolling update deployment type starts a new deployment, the service scheduler will launch new tasks until the desired count is reached. You can optionally use deployment circuit breaker logic on the service, which will cause the deployment to transition to a failed state if it can't reach a steady state. The deployment circuit breaker logic can also trigger Amazon ECS to roll back to the last completed deployment upon a deployment failure.
The following create-service AWS CLI example shows how to create a Linux service when the deployment circuit breaker enabled with rollback.
aws ecs create-service \ --service-name MyService \ --deployment-controller type=ECS \ --desired-count 2 \ --deployment-configuration "deploymentCircuitBreaker={enable=true,rollback=true}" \ --task-definition sample-fargate:1 \ --launch-type FARGATE \ --platform-os LINUX \ --platform-version 1.4.0 \ --network-configuration
"awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-12344321],securityGroups=[sg-12344321],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}"
The following should be considered when enabling the deployment circuit breaker logic on a service.
· The deployment circuit breaker is only supported for Amazon ECS services that use the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller and don't use a Classic Load Balancer.
· If a service deployment has at least one successfully running task, the circuit breaker logic will not trigger regardless of the deployment having any previous or future failed tasks.
· There are two new parameters added to the response of a DescribeServices API action that provide insight into the state of a deployment, the rolloutState and rolloutStateReason. When a new deployment is started, the rollout state begins in an IN_PROGRESS state. When the service reaches a steady state, the rollout state transitions to COMPLETED. If the service fails to reach a steady state and circuit breaker is enabled, the deployment will transition to a FAILED state. A deployment in a FAILED state won't launch any new tasks.
· In addition to the service deployment state change events Amazon ECS sends for deployments that have started and have completed, Amazon ECS also sends an event when a deployment with circuit breaker enabled fails. These events provide details about why a deployment failed or if a deployment was started because of a rollback. For more information, see Service deployment state change events (p. 304).
241

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Rolling update

· If a new deployment is started because a previous deployment failed and rollback was enabled, the
reason field of the service deployment state change event will indicate the deployment was started because of a rollback.

Failure threshold
The deployment circuit breaker calculates the threshold value, and then uses the value to determine when to move the deployment to a FAILED state.
The deployment circuit breaker has a minimum threshold of 10 and a maximum threshold of 200. and uses the values in the following formula to determine the deployment failure.
Minimum threshold <= 0.5 * desired task count => maximum threshold
When the result of the calculation is less than the minimum of 10, the failure threshold is set to 10. When the result of the calculation is greater than the maximum of 200, the failure threshold is set to 200.
Note You cannot change either of the threshold values.
There are two stages for the deployment status check.
1. The deployment circuit breaker monitors tasks that are part of the deployment and checks for tasks that are in the RUNNING state. The scheduler ignores the failure criteria when a task in the current deployment is in the RUNNING state and proceeds to the next stage. When tasks fail to reach in the RUNNING state, the deployment circuit breaker increases the failure count by one. When the failure count equals the threshold, the deployment is marked as FAILED.
2. This stage is entered when there are one of more tasks in the RUNNING state. The deployment circuit breaker performs health checks on the following resources for the tasks in the current deployment: · Elastic Load Balancing load balancers · AWS Cloud Map service · Amazon ECS container health checks
When a health check fails for the task, the deployment circuit breaker increases the failure count by one. When the failure count equals the threshold, the deployment is marked as FAILED.

The following table provides some examples.

Desired task count 1 25 400 800

Calculation
10 <= 0.5 * 1 => 200 10 <= 0.5 * 25 => 200 10 <= 0.5 * 400 => 200 10 <= 0.5 * 800 => 200

Threshold 10 (the calculated value is less than the minimum) 13 (the value is rounded up)
200
200 (the calculated value is greater than the maximum)

For additional examples about using the rollback option, see Announcing Amazon ECS deployment circuit breaker.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy

Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy
The blue/green deployment type uses the blue/green deployment model controlled by CodeDeploy. This deployment type enables you to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it. For more information, see What Is CodeDeploy? in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.
There are three ways traffic can shift during a blue/green deployment:
· Canary -- Traffic is shifted in two increments. You can choose from predefined canary options that specify the percentage of traffic shifted to your updated task set in the first increment and the interval, in minutes, before the remaining traffic is shifted in the second increment.
· Linear -- Traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment. You can choose from predefined linear options that specify the percentage of traffic shifted in each increment and the number of minutes between each increment.
· All-at-once -- All traffic is shifted from the original task set to the updated task set all at once.
The following are components of CodeDeploy that Amazon ECS uses when a service uses the blue/green deployment type:
CodeDeploy application
A collection of CodeDeploy resources. This consists of one or more deployment groups. CodeDeploy deployment group
The deployment settings. This consists of the following: · Amazon ECS cluster and service · Load balancer target group and listener information · Deployment roll back strategy · Traffic rerouting settings · Original revision termination settings · Deployment configuration · CloudWatch alarms configuration that can be set up to stop deployments · SNS or CloudWatch Events settings for notifications
For more information, see Working with Deployment Groups in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide. CodeDeploy deployment configuration
Specifies how CodeDeploy routes production traffic to your replacement task set during a deployment. The following pre-defined linear and canary deployment configuration are available. You can also create custom defined linear and canary deployments as well. For more information, see Working with Deployment Configurations in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.

CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce

Shifts all traffic to the updated Amazon ECS container at once.

Revision
A revision is the CodeDeploy application specification file (AppSpec file). In the AppSpec file, you specify the full ARN of the task definition and the container and port of your replacement task set where traffic is to be routed when a new deployment is created. The container name must be one of the container names referenced in your task definition. If the network configuration or platform version has been updated in the service definition, you must also specify those details in the AppSpec file. You can also specify the Lambda functions to run during the deployment lifecycle events. The Lambda functions allow you to run tests and return metrics during the deployment. For more information, see AppSpec File Reference in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.
Blue/Green Deployment Considerations
Consider the following when using the blue/green deployment type:
· When an Amazon ECS service using the blue/green deployment type is initially created, an Amazon ECS task set is created.
· You must configure the service to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. Classic Load Balancers aren't supported. The following are the load balancer requirements:
· You must add a production listener to the load balancer, which is used to route production traffic.
· An optional test listener can be added to the load balancer, which is used to route test traffic. If you specify a test listener, CodeDeploy routes your test traffic to the replacement task set during a deployment.
· Both the production and test listeners must belong to the same load balancer.
· You must define a target group for the load balancer. The target group routes traffic to the original task set in a service through the production listener.
· When a Network Load Balancer is used, only the CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce deployment configuration is supported.
· For services configured to use service auto scaling and the blue/green deployment type, auto scaling is not blocked during a deployment but the deployment may fail under some circumstances. The following describes this behavior in more detail.
· If a service is scaling and a deployment starts, the green task set is created and CodeDeploy will wait up to an hour for the green task set to reach steady state and won't shift any traffic until it does.
· If a service is in the process of a blue/green deployment and a scaling event occurs, traffic will continue to shift for 5 minutes. If the service doesn't reach steady state within 5 minutes, CodeDeploy will stop the deployment and mark it as failed.
· If a service is in the process of a blue/green deployment and a scaling event occurs, the desired task count might be set to an unexpected value. This is caused by auto scaling considering the running task count as current capacity, which is twice the appropriate number of tasks being used in the desired task count calculation.
· Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller types don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.

244

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy
· When you initially create a CodeDeploy application and deployment group, you must specify the following: · You must define two target groups for the load balancer. One target group should be the initial target group defined for the load balancer when the Amazon ECS service was created. The second target group's only requirement is that it can't be associated with a different load balancer than the one the service uses.
· When you create a CodeDeploy deployment for an Amazon ECS service, CodeDeploy creates a replacement task set (or green task set) in the deployment. If you added a test listener to the load balancer, CodeDeploy routes your test traffic to the replacement task set. This is when you can run any validation tests. Then CodeDeploy reroutes the production traffic from the original task set to the replacement task set according to the traffic rerouting settings for the deployment group.
Amazon ECS console experience
The service create and service update workflows in the Amazon ECS console supports blue/green deployments.
To create an Amazon ECS service that uses the blue/green deployment type, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226).
To update an existing Amazon ECS service that is using the blue/green deployment type, see Updating a service (p. 237).
When you use the Amazon ECS console to create an Amazon ECS service using the blue/green deployment type, an Amazon ECS task set and the following CodeDeploy resources are created automatically with the following default settings.

Resource Application name Deployment group name Deployment group load balancer info Traffic rerouting settings
Original revision termination settings Deployment configuration

Default Setting
AppECS-<cluster[:47]>-<service[:47]>
DgpECS-<cluster[:47]>-<service[:47]>
The load balancer production listener, optional test listener, and target groups specified are added to the deployment group configuration.
Traffic rerouting ­ The default setting is Reroute traffic immediately. You can change it on the CodeDeploy console or by updating the TrafficRoutingConfig. For more information, see CreateDeploymentConfig in the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference.
The original revision termination settings are configured to wait 1 hour after traffic has been rerouted before terminating the blue task set.
The deployment configuration is set to CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce by default, which routes all traffic at one time from the blue task set to the green task set. The deployment configuration can be changed using the AWS CodeDeploy console after the service is created.

245

Resource Automatic rollback configuration

Default Setting
If a deployment fails, the automatic rollback settings are configured to roll it back.

To view details of an Amazon ECS service using the blue/green deployment type, use the Deployments tab on the Amazon ECS console.
To view the details of a CodeDeploy deployment group in the CodeDeploy console, see View Deployment Group Details with CodeDeploy in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.
To modify the settings for a CodeDeploy deployment group in the CodeDeploy console, see Change Deployment Group Settings with CodeDeploy in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.
Support for performing a blue/green deployment has been added for AWS CloudFormation. For more information, see Perform Amazon ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy using AWS CloudFormation in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
Blue/green deployment required IAM permissions
Amazon ECS blue/green deployments are made possible by a combination of the Amazon ECS and CodeDeploy APIs. IAM users must have the appropriate permissions for these services before they can use Amazon ECS blue/green deployments in the AWS Management Console or with the AWS CLI or SDKs.
In addition to the standard IAM permissions for creating and updating services, Amazon ECS requires the following permissions. These permissions have been added to the AmazonECS_FullAccess IAM policy. For more information, see AmazonECS_FullAccess (p. 341).
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "codedeploy:CreateApplication", "codedeploy:CreateDeployment", "codedeploy:CreateDeploymentGroup", "codedeploy:GetApplication", "codedeploy:GetDeployment", "codedeploy:GetDeploymentGroup", "codedeploy:ListApplications", "codedeploy:ListDeploymentGroups", "codedeploy:ListDeployments", "codedeploy:StopDeployment", "codedeploy:GetDeploymentTarget", "codedeploy:ListDeploymentTargets", "codedeploy:GetDeploymentConfig", "codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision", "codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision", "codedeploy:BatchGetApplicationRevisions", "codedeploy:BatchGetDeploymentGroups", "codedeploy:BatchGetDeployments", "codedeploy:BatchGetApplications", "codedeploy:ListApplicationRevisions", "codedeploy:ListDeploymentConfigs", "codedeploy:ContinueDeployment", "sns:ListTopics", "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms", "lambda:ListFunctions" ],

246

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate External deployment
"Resource": [ "*"
] } ] }
Note In addition to the standard Amazon ECS permissions required to run tasks and services, IAM users also require iam:PassRole permissions to use IAM roles for tasks.
CodeDeploy needs permissions to call Amazon ECS APIs, modify your Elastic Load Balancing, invoke Lambda functions, and describe CloudWatch alarms, as well as permissions to modify your service's desired count on your behalf. Before creating an Amazon ECS service that uses the blue/green deployment type, you must create an IAM role (ecsCodeDeployRole). For more information, see Amazon ECS CodeDeploy IAM Role (p. 365).
The Create Service Example (p. 338) and Update Service Example (p. 339) IAM policy examples show the permissions that are required for IAM users to use Amazon ECS blue/green deployments on the AWS Management Console.
External deployment
The external deployment type enables you to use any third-party deployment controller for full control over the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service. The details for your service are managed by either the service management API actions (CreateService, UpdateService, and DeleteService) or the task set management API actions (CreateTaskSet, UpdateTaskSet, UpdateServicePrimaryTaskSet, and DeleteTaskSet). Each API action has a subset of the service definition parameters that it can manage.
The UpdateService API action updates the desired count and health check grace period parameters for a service. If the launch type, platform version, load balancer details, network configuration, or task definition need to be updated, you must create a new task set.
The UpdateTaskSet API action updates only the scale parameter for a task set.
The UpdateServicePrimaryTaskSet API action modifies which task set in a service is the primary task set. When you call the DescribeServices API action, it returns all fields specified for a primary task set. If the primary task set for a service is updated, any task set parameter values that exist on the new primary task set that differ from the old primary task set in a service are updated to the new value when a new primary task set is defined. If no primary task set is defined for a service, when describing the service, the task set fields are null.
External deployment considerations
Consider the following when using the external deployment type:
· Service auto scaling is not supported when using an external deployment controller. · If using a load balancer for the task, the supported load balancer types are either an Application Load
Balancer or a Network Load Balancer. · Tasks using the Fargate launch type or EXTERNAL deployment controller types don't support the
DAEMON scheduling strategy.
External deployment workflow
The following is the basic workflow to managing an external deployment on Amazon ECS.
247

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate External deployment
To manage an Amazon ECS service using an external deployment controller
1. Create an Amazon ECS service. The only required parameter is the service name. You can specify the following parameters when creating a service using an external deployment controller. All other service parameters are specified when creating a task set within the service.
serviceName
Type: String
Required: Yes
The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions. desiredCount
The number of instantiations of the specified task set task definition to place and keep running within the service. deploymentConfiguration
Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during a deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks. For more information, see deploymentConfiguration. tags
Type: Array of objects
Required: No
The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well. A maximum of 50 tags can be applied to the service. For more information, see Tagging your Amazon ECS resources (p. 276). key
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Required: No
One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values. value
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 256.
Required: No
The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key). enableECSManagedTags
Specifies whether to use Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service. For more information, see Tagging your resources for billing (p. 278).
248

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate External deployment
propagateTags
Type: String
Valid values: TASK_DEFINITION | SERVICE
Required: No
Specifies whether to copy the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks in the service. If no value is specified, the tags are not copied. Tags can only be copied to the tasks within the service during service creation. To add tags to a task after service creation or task creation, use the TagResource API action. healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds
Type: Integer
Required: No
The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks, container health checks, and Route 53 health checks after a task enters a RUNNING state. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you do not specify a health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used.
If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores the health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use the startPeriod in the task definition health check parameters. For more information, see Health check. schedulingStrategy
The scheduling strategy to use. Services using an external deployment controller support only the REPLICA scheduling strategy. For more information, see Service scheduler concepts (p. 212). placementConstraints
An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at run time). If you are using the Fargate launch type, task placement constraints aren't supported. placementStrategy
The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of four strategy rules per service.
The following is an example service definition for creating a service using an external deployment controller.
{ "cluster": "", "serviceName": "", "desiredCount": 0, "role": "", "deploymentConfiguration": { "maximumPercent": 0, 249

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate External deployment
"minimumHealthyPercent": 0 }, "placementConstraints": [
{ "type": "distinctInstance", "expression": ""
} ], "placementStrategy": [
{ "type": "binpack", "field": ""
} ], "healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds": 0, "schedulingStrategy": "REPLICA", "deploymentController": {
"type": "EXTERNAL" }, "tags": [
{ "key": "", "value": ""
} ], "enableECSManagedTags": true, "propagateTags": "TASK_DEFINITION" }
2. Create an initial task set. The task set contains the following details about your service:
taskDefinition
The task definition for the tasks in the task set to use.
launchType
Type: String
Valid values: EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL
Required: No
The launch type on which to run your service. If a launch type is not specified, EC2 is used by default. For more information, see Amazon ECS launch types (p. 124).
If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be omitted. platformVersion
Type: String
Required: No
The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the latest version (LATEST) is used by default.
AWS Fargate platform versions are used to refer to a specific runtime environment for the Fargate task infrastructure. When specifying the LATEST platform version when running a task or creating a service, you get the most current platform version available for your tasks. When you scale up your service, those tasks receive the platform version that was specified on the service's current deployment. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
250

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate External deployment
loadBalancers
A load balancer object representing the load balancer to use with your service. When using an external deployment controller, only Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers are supported. If you're using an Application Load Balancer, only one Application Load Balancer target group is allowed per task set.
The following snippet shows an example loadBalancer object to use.
"loadBalancers": [ { "targetGroupArn": "", "containerName": "", "containerPort": 0 }
]
Note When specifying a loadBalancer object, you must specify a targetGroupArn and omit the loadBalancerName parameters.
networkConfiguration
The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it's not supported for other network modes. For more information, see Fargate Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate..
serviceRegistries
The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this service. For more information, see Service Discovery (p. 271).
scale
A floating-point percentage of the desired number of tasks to place and keep running in the task set. The value is specified as a percent total of a service's desiredCount. Accepted values are numbers between 0 and 100.
The following is a JSON example for creating a task set for an external deployment controller.
{ "service": "", "cluster": "", "externalId": "", "taskDefinition": "", "networkConfiguration": { "awsvpcConfiguration": { "subnets": [ "" ], "securityGroups": [ "" ], "assignPublicIp": "DISABLED" } }, "loadBalancers": [ { "targetGroupArn": "", "containerName": "", "containerPort": 0
251

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service load balancing
} ], "serviceRegistries": [
{ "registryArn": "", "port": 0, "containerName": "", "containerPort": 0
} ], "launchType": "EC2", "capacityProviderStrategy": [
{ "capacityProvider": "", "weight": 0, "base": 0
} ], "platformVersion": "", "scale": {
"value": null, "unit": "PERCENT" }, "clientToken": "" }
3. When service changes are needed, use the UpdateService, UpdateTaskSet, or CreateTaskSet API action depending on which parameters you're updating. If you created a task set, use the scale parameter for each task set in a service to determine how many tasks to keep running in the service. For example, if you have a service that contains tasksetA and you create a tasksetB, you might test the validity of tasksetB before wanting to transition production traffic to it. You could set the scale for both task sets to 100, and when you were ready to transition all production traffic to tasksetB, you could update the scale for tasksetA to 0 to scale it down.
Service load balancing
Your Amazon ECS service can optionally be configured to use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly across the tasks in your service.
Note When you use tasks sets, all the tasks in the set must all be configured to use Elastic Load Balancing or to not use Elastic Load Balancing.
Amazon ECS services hosted on AWS Fargate support the Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer load balancer types. Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or layer 7) traffic. Network Load Balancers are used to route TCP or UDP (or layer 4) traffic. For more information, see Load balancer types (p. 254).
Application Load Balancers offer several features that make them attractive for use with Amazon ECS services:
· Each service can serve traffic from multiple load balancers and expose multiple load balanced ports by specifying multiple target groups.
· Application Load Balancers allow containers to use dynamic host port mapping (so that multiple tasks from the same service are allowed per container instance).
· Application Load Balancers support path-based routing and priority rules (so that multiple services can use the same listener port on a single Application Load Balancer).
252

Service load balancing considerations
Consider the following when you use service load balancing.
Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer considerations
The following considerations are specific to Amazon ECS services using Application Load Balancers or Network Load Balancers:
· Amazon ECS requires the service-linked IAM role which provides the permissions needed to register and deregister targets with your load balancer when tasks are created and stopped. For more information, see Service-linked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348).
· For services that use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you cannot attach more than five target groups to a service.
· When you create a target group for your service, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance.
· If your service uses an Application Load Balancer and requires access to multiple load balanced ports, such as port 80 and port 443 for an HTTP/HTTPS service, you can configure two listeners. One listener is responsible for HTTPS that forwards the request to the service, and another listener that is responsible for redirecting HTTP requests to the appropriate HTTPS port. For more information, see Create a listener to your Application Load Balancer in the User Guide for Application Load Balancers.
· After you create a service, the target group ARN or load balancer name, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. You can use the AWS CLI or SDK to modify the load balancer configuration. For information about how to modify the configuration, see UpdateService in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference. You cannot add, remove, or change the load balancer configuration of an existing service. If you update the task definition for the service, the container name and container port that were specified when the service was created must remain in the task definition.
· If a service's task fails the load balancer health check criteria, the task is stopped and restarted. This process continues until your service reaches the number of desired running tasks.
· When using Network Load Balancers configured with IP addresses as targets, requests are seen as coming from the Network Load Balancers private IP address. This means that services behind an Network Load Balancer are effectively open to the world as soon as you allow incoming requests and health checks in the target's security group.
· Using a Network Load Balancer to route UDP traffic to your Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate require the task to use platform version 1.4.0 (Linux) or 1.0.0 (Windows).
· Minimize errors in your client applications by setting the StopTimeout in the task definition longer than the target group deregistration delay, which should be longer than your client connection timeout. See the Builders Library for more information on recommended client configuration here .
Also, the Network Load Balancer target group attribute for connection termination closes all remaining connections after the deregistration time. This can cause clients to display undesired error messages, if the client does not handle them.

Load balancer types
Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. Amazon ECS services can use these types of load balancer. Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or Layer 7) traffic. Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers are used to route TCP (or Layer 4) traffic. Topics
· Application Load Balancer (p. 254) · Network Load Balancer (p. 255) · Gateway Load Balancers (p. 255)
Application Load Balancer
An Application Load Balancer makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based routing, and can route requests to one or more ports on each container instance in your cluster. Application Load Balancers support dynamic host port mapping. For example, if your task's container definition specifies port 80 for an NGINX container port, and port 0 for the host port, then the host port is dynamically chosen from the ephemeral port range of the container instance (such as 32768 to 61000 on the latest Amazon ECS-optimized AMI). When the task is launched, the NGINX container is registered with the Application Load Balancer as an instance ID and port combination, and traffic is distributed to the instance ID and port corresponding to that container. This dynamic mapping allows you to have multiple tasks from a single service on the same container instance. For more information, see the User Guide for Application Load Balancers.
254

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Load balancer types
Network Load Balancer
A Network Load Balancer makes routing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/SSL). It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule using a flow hash routing algorithm. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration. It forwards the request without modifying the headers. Network Load Balancers support dynamic host port mapping. For example, if your task's container definition specifies port 80 for an NGINX container port, and port 0 for the host port, then the host port is dynamically chosen from the ephemeral port range of the container instance (such as 32768 to 61000 on the latest Amazon ECS-optimized AMI). When the task is launched, the NGINX container is registered with the Network Load Balancer as an instance ID and port combination, and traffic is distributed to the instance ID and port corresponding to that container. This dynamic mapping allows you to have multiple tasks from a single service on the same container instance. For more information, see the User Guide for Network Load Balancers.
Gateway Load Balancers
Gateway Load Balancers allow you to deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems. It combines a transparent network gateway (that is, a single entry and exit point for all traffic) and distributes traffic while scaling your virtual appliances with the demand. A Gateway Load Balancer operates at the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the network layer. It listens for all IP packets across all ports and forwards traffic to the target group that's specified in the listener rule. It maintains stickiness of flows to a specific target appliance using 5-tuple (for TCP/UDP flows) or 3-tuple (for nonTCP/UDP flows). The Gateway Load Balancer and its registered virtual appliance instances exchange application traffic using the GENEVE protocol on port 6081. It supports a maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of 8500 bytes. Gateway Load Balancers use Gateway Load Balancer endpoints to securely exchange traffic across VPC boundaries. A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is a VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity between virtual appliances in the service provider VPC and application
255

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a load balancer
servers in the service consumer VPC. You deploy the Gateway Load Balancer in the same VPC as the virtual appliances. You register the virtual appliances with a target group for the Gateway Load Balancer. For more information, see the Gateway Load Balancers User Guide.
Creating a load balancer
This section provides a hands-on introduction to using Elastic Load Balancing through the AWS Management Console to use with your Amazon ECS services. In this section, you create an external load balancer that receives public network traffic and routes it to your Amazon ECS container instances.
Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers, and Amazon ECS services can use either type of load balancer. Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers are used to route TCP or Layer 4 traffic.
Application Load Balancers offer several features that make them attractive for use with Amazon ECS services:
· Application Load Balancers allow containers to use dynamic host port mapping (so that multiple tasks from the same service are allowed per container instance).
· Application Load Balancers support path-based routing and priority rules (so that multiple services can use the same listener port on a single Application Load Balancer).
We recommend that you use Application Load Balancers for your Amazon ECS services so that you can take advantage of these latest features. For more information about Elastic Load Balancing and the differences between the load balancer types, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide.
Prior to using a load balancer with your Amazon ECS service, your account must already have the Amazon ECS service-linked role created. For more information, see Service-linked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348).

Configure a target group for routing
In this section, you create a target group for your load balancer and the health check criteria for targets that are registered within that group.
Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When a rule condition is met, traffic is forwarded to the corresponding target group.
Your load balancer distributes traffic between the targets that are registered to its target groups. When you associate a target group to an Amazon ECS service, Amazon ECS automatically registers and
256

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a load balancer
deregisters containers with your target group. Because Amazon ECS handles target registration, you do not add targets to your target group at this time.
To create a target group
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. 2. On the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Target Groups. 3. Choose Create target group. 4. For Choose a target type, select the target type.
Important If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), you must choose IP addresses as the target type This is because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. 5. For Target group name, type a name for the target group. This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen. 6. (Optional) For Protocol and Port, modify the default values as needed. 7. If the target type is IP addresses, choose IPv4. 8. For VPC, select a virtual private cloud (VPC). Note that for IP addresses target types, the VPCs available for selection are those that support the IP address type that you chose in the previous step. 9. (Optional) For Protocol version, leave the default. 10. (Optional) In the Health checks section, keep the default settings. 11. (Optional) Add one or more tags as follows:
a. Expand the Tags section. b. Choose Add tag. c. Enter the tag key and the tag value. 12. Choose Next. 13. Choose Create target group.
Define your load balancer
First, provide some basic configuration information for your load balancer, such as a name, a network, and a listener.
A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and a port for the frontend (client to load balancer) connections, and protocol and a port for the backend (load balancer to backend instance) connections. In this example, you configure a listener that accepts HTTP requests on port 80 and sends them to the containers in your tasks on port 80 using HTTP.
To configure your load balancer and listener
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. 2. In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Load Balancers. 3. Choose Create Load Balancer. 4. Under Application Load Balancer, choose Create. 5. Under Basic configuration, do the following:
a. For Load balancer name, enter a name for your load balancer. For example, my-alb. The name of your Application Load Balancer must be unique within your set of Application Load Balancers
257

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a load balancer
and Network Load Balancers for the Region. Names can have a maximum of 32 characters, and can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens. They cannot begin or end with a hyphen, or with internal-. b. For Scheme, choose Internet-facing or Internal. An internet-facing load balancer routes requests from clients to targets over the internet. An internal load balancer routes requests to targets using private IP addresses. c. For IP address type, choose IPv4 or Dualstack. Use IPv4 if your clients use IPv4 addresses to communicate with the load balancer. Choose Dualstack if your clients use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to communicate with the load balancer. 6. Under Network mapping, do the following:
a. For VPC, select the same VPC that you used for the container instances on which you intend to run your service.
b. For Mappings, select the check box for the Availability Zones to use for your load balancer. If there is one subnet for that Availability Zone, it is selected. If there is more than one subnet for that Availability Zone, select one of the subnets. You can select only one subnet per Availability Zone. Your load balancer subnet configuration must include all Availability Zones that your container instances reside in.
7. Under Security groups, do the following:
For Security groups, select an existing security group, or create a new one.
The security group for your load balancer must allow it to communicate with registered targets on both the listener port and the health check port. The console can create a security group for your load balancer on your behalf with rules that allow this communication. You can also create a security group and select it instead. For information about how to create a security group, see Security groups for your Application Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing Application Load Balancers.
(Optional) To create a new security group for your load balancer, choose Create a new security group. 8. Under Listeners and routing, do the following:
The default listener accepts HTTP traffic on port 80. You can keep the default protocol and port. For Default action, choose the target group that you created. You can optionally choose Add listener to add another listener (for example, an HTTPS listener).
If you create an HTTPS listener, configure the required
When you use HTTPS for your load balancer listener, you must deploy an SSL certificate on your load balancer. The load balancer uses this certificate to terminate the connection and decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the targets. Under Secure listener settings, do the following:
a. For Select policy, choose a predefined security policy. For details on the security policies, see Security Policies in Elastic Load Balancing Application Load Balancers.
b. For Default SSL certificate, do one of the following:
· If you created or imported a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, select From ACM, and then select the certificate.
· If you uploaded a certificate using IAM, select From IAM, and then select the certificate. · If you want to import a certificate to ACM or IAM , enter a certificate name. Then, paste the
PEM-encoded private key and body. 9. (Optional) You can use Add-on services, such as the AWS Global Accelerator to create an
accelerator and associate the load balancer with the accelerator. The accelerator name can have up to 64 characters. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, . and - (hyphen). After the accelerator is created, you can use the AWS Global Accelerator console to manage it. 10. (Optional) Tag your Application Load Balancer. Under Tag and create, do the following
258

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a load balancer
a. Expand the Tags section. b. Choose Add tag. c. Enter the tag key and the tag value. 11. Review your configuration, and choose Create load balancer.
Create a security group rule for your container instances
After your Application Load Balancer has been created, you must add an inbound rule to your container instance security group that allows traffic from your load balancer to reach the containers.
To allow inbound traffic from your load balancer to your container instances
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. 2. In the left navigation, choose Security Groups. 3. Choose the security group that your container instances use. If you created your container instances
by using the Amazon ECS first run wizard, this security group may have the description, ECS Allowed Ports. 4. Choose the Inbound tab, and then choose Edit inbound rules. 5. For Type, choose All traffic. 6. For Source, choose Custom, and then select the Application Load Balancer security group. This rule allows all traffic from your Application Load Balancer to reach the containers in your tasks that are registered with your load balancer. 7. Choose Save to finish.
Create an Amazon ECS service
After your load balancer and target group are created, you can specify the target group in a service definition when you create a service. When each task for your service is started, the container and port combination specified in the service definition is registered with your target group and traffic is routed from the load balancer to that container. For more information, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226).
Creating a Network Load Balancer
This section walks you through the process of creating a Network Load Balancer in the AWS Management Console.
Define your load balancer
First, provide some basic configuration information for your load balancer, such as a name, a network, and a listener.
A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and port for the frontend (client to load balancer) connections, and a protocol and port for the backend (load balancer to backend instance) connections. In this example, you configure an Internet-facing load balancer in the selected network with a listener that receives TCP traffic on port 80.
To define your load balancer
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. 2. From the navigation bar, select a region for your load balancer. Be sure to select the same region
that you selected for your Amazon ECS container instances. 3. In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.
259

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating a load balancer
4. Choose Create Load Balancer. 5. On the Select load balancer type page, choose Create under Network Load Balancer. 6. Complete the Configure Load Balancer page as follows:
a. For Name, type a name for your load balancer. b. For Scheme, choose either internet-facing or internal. An internet-facing load balancer routes
requests from clients over the internet to targets. An internal load balancer routes requests to targets using private IP addresses. c. For Listeners, the default is a listener that accepts TCP traffic on port 80. You can keep the default listener settings, modify the protocol or port of the listener, or choose Add listener to add another listener. d. For Availability Zones, select the VPC that you used for your Amazon EC2 instances. For each Availability Zone that you used to launch your Amazon EC2 instances, select an Availability Zone and then select the public subnet for that Availability Zone. To associate an Elastic IP address with the subnet, select it from Elastic IP. e. Choose Next: Configure Routing.
Configure routing
You register targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, with a target group. The target group that you configure in this step is used as the target group in the listener rule, which forwards requests to the target group. For more information, see Target Groups for Your Network Load Balancers in the User Guide for Network Load Balancers.
To configure your target group
1. For Target group, keep the default, New target group. 2. For Name, type a name for the target group. 3. Set Protocol and Port as needed. 4. For Target type, choose whether to register your targets with an instance ID or an IP address.
Important If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), you must choose ip as the target type, not instance. This is because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. You cannot register instances by instance ID if they have the following instance types: C1, CC1, CC2, CG1, CG2, CR1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2, M3, and T1. You can register instances of these types by IP address. 5. For Health checks, keep the default health check settings. 6. Choose Next: Register Targets.
Register targets with the target group
Your load balancer distributes traffic between the targets that are registered to its target groups. When you associate a target group to an Amazon ECS service, Amazon ECS automatically registers and deregisters containers with your target group. Because Amazon ECS handles target registration, you do not add targets to your target group at this time.
To skip target registration
1. In the Registered instances section, ensure that no instances are selected for registration. 2. Choose Next: Review to go to the next page in the wizard.
260

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Registering multiple target groups with a service
Review and create
Review your load balancer and target group configuration and choose Create to create your load balancer.
Create an Amazon ECS service
After your load balancer and target group are created, you can specify the target group in a service definition when you create a service. When each task for your service is started, the container and port combination specified in the service definition is registered with your target group and traffic is routed from the load balancer to that container. For more information, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226).
Registering multiple target groups with a service
Your Amazon ECS service can serve traffic from multiple load balancers and expose multiple load balanced ports when you specify multiple target groups in a service definition.
To create a service specifying multiple target groups, you must create the service using the Amazon ECS API, SDK, AWS CLI, or an AWS CloudFormation template. After the service is created, you can view the service and the target groups registered to it with the AWS Management Console. You must use UpdateService to modify the load balancer configuration of an existing service.
Multiple target groups can be specified in a service definition using the following format. For the full syntax of a service definition, see Service definition template (p. 224).
"loadBalancers":[ {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_1/1234567890123456",
"containerName":"container_name", "containerPort":container_port }, {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_2/6543210987654321",
"containerName":"container_name", "containerPort":container_port } ]
Multiple target group considerations
The following should be considered when you specify multiple target groups in a service definition.
· For services that use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you cannot attach more than five target groups to a service.
· Specifying multiple target groups in a service definition is only supported under the following conditions: · The service must use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. · The service must use the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller type.
· Specifying multiple target groups is supported for services containing tasks using both the Fargate and EC2 launch types.
· When creating a service that specifies multiple target groups, the Amazon ECS service-linked role must be created. The role is created by omitting the role parameter in API requests, or the Role property in AWS CloudFormation. For more information, see Service-linked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348).
261

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Registering multiple target groups with a service
Example service definitions
Following are a few example use cases for specifying multiple target groups in a service definition. For the full syntax of a service definition, see Service definition template (p. 224).
Example: Having separate load balancers for internal and external traffic
In the following use case, a service uses two separate load balancers, one for internal traffic and a second for internet-facing traffic, for the same container and port.
"loadBalancers":[ //Internal ELB {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_1/1234567890123456",
"containerName":"nginx", "containerPort":8080 }, //Internet-facing ELB {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_2/6543210987654321",
"containerName":"nginx", "containerPort":8080 } ]
Example: Exposing multiple ports from the same container
In the following use case, a service uses one load balancer but exposes multiple ports from the same container. For example, a Jenkins container might expose port 8080 for the Jenkins web interface and port 50000 for the API.
"loadBalancers":[ {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_1/1234567890123456",
"containerName":"jenkins", "containerPort":8080 }, {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_2/6543210987654321",
"containerName":"jenkins", "containerPort":50000 } ]
Example: Exposing ports from multiple containers
In the following use case, a service uses one load balancer and two target groups to expose ports from separate containers.
"loadBalancers":[ {
262

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service auto scaling
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_1/1234567890123456",
"containerName":"webserver", "containerPort":80 }, {
"targetGroupArn":"arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:123456789012:targetgroup/ target_group_name_2/6543210987654321",
"containerName":"database", "containerPort":3306 } ]
Service auto scaling
Automatic scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the desired count of tasks in your Amazon ECS service automatically. Amazon ECS leverages the Application Auto Scaling service to provide this functionality. For more information, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.
Amazon ECS publishes CloudWatch metrics with your service's average CPU and memory usage. For more information, see Service utilization (p. 293). You can use these and other CloudWatch metrics to scale out your service (add more tasks) to deal with high demand at peak times, and to scale in your service (run fewer tasks) to reduce costs during periods of low utilization.
Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling supports the following types of automatic scaling:
· Target tracking scaling policies (p. 265)--Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on a target value for a specific metric. This is similar to the way that your thermostat maintains the temperature of your home. You select temperature and the thermostat does the rest.
· Step scaling policies (p. 269)--Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, that vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
· Scheduled Scaling--Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on the date and time.
Service auto scaling and deployments
Application Auto Scaling disables scale-in processes while Amazon ECS deployments are in progress. However, scale-out processes continue to occur, unless suspended, during a deployment. If you want to suspend scale-out processes while deployments are in progress, take the following steps.
1. Call the describe-scalable-targets command, specifying the resource ID of the ECS service associated with the scalable target in Application Auto Scaling (Example: service/default/samplewebapp). Record the output. You will need it when you call the next command.
2. Call the register-scalable-target command, specifying the resource ID, namespace, and scalable dimension. Specify true for both DynamicScalingInSuspended and DynamicScalingOutSuspended.
3. After deployment is complete, you can call the register-scalable-target command to resume scaling.
For more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling for Application Auto Scaling.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate IAM permissions required for service auto scaling
IAM permissions required for service auto scaling
Service auto scaling is made possible by a combination of the Amazon ECS, CloudWatch, and Application Auto Scaling APIs. Services are created and updated with Amazon ECS, alarms are created with CloudWatch, and scaling policies are created with Application Auto Scaling.
In addition to the standard IAM permissions for creating and updating services, the IAM user that accesses Service Auto Scaling settings must have the appropriate permissions for the services that support dynamic scaling. IAM users must have permissions to use the actions shown in the following example policy.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "application-autoscaling:*", "ecs:DescribeServices", "ecs:UpdateService", "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms", "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm", "cloudwatch:DeleteAlarms", "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarmHistory", "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarmsForMetric", "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics", "cloudwatch:ListMetrics", "cloudwatch:DisableAlarmActions", "cloudwatch:EnableAlarmActions", "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole", "sns:CreateTopic", "sns:Subscribe", "sns:Get*", "sns:List*" ], "Resource": [ "*" ] } ]
}
The Create Service Example (p. 338) and Update Service Example (p. 339) IAM policy examples show the permissions that are required for IAM users to use Service Auto Scaling in the AWS Management Console.
The Application Auto Scaling service also needs permission to describe your Amazon ECS services and CloudWatch alarms, and permissions to modify your service's desired count on your behalf. The sns: permissions are for the notifications that CloudWatch sends to an Amazon SNS topic when a threshold has been exceeded. If you use automatic scaling for your Amazon ECS services, it creates a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_ECSService. This service-linked role grants Application Auto Scaling permission to describe the alarms for your policies, to monitor the current running task count of the service, and to modify the desired count of the service. The original managed Amazon ECS role for Application Auto Scaling was ecsAutoscaleRole, but it is no longer required. The service-linked role is the default role for Application Auto Scaling. For more information, see Service-linked roles for Application Auto Scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Target tracking scaling policies
Target tracking scaling policies
With target tracking scaling policies, you select a metric and set a target value. Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value. The scaling policy adds or removes service tasks as required to keep the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the target value, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to the fluctuations in the metric due to a fluctuating load pattern and minimizes rapid fluctuations in the number of tasks running in your service.
Considerations
Keep the following considerations in mind.
· A target tracking scaling policy assumes that it should perform scale out when the specified metric is above the target value. You cannot use a target tracking scaling policy to scale out when the specified metric is below the target value.
· A target tracking scaling policy does not perform scaling when the specified metric has insufficient data. It does not perform scale in because it does not interpret insufficient data as low utilization.
· You may see gaps between the target value and the actual metric data points. This is because Service Auto Scaling always acts conservatively by rounding up or down when it determines how much capacity to add or remove. This prevents it from adding insufficient capacity or removing too much capacity.
· To ensure application availability, the service scales out proportionally to the metric as fast as it can, but scales in more gradually.
· Application Auto Scaling disables scale-in processes while Amazon ECS deployments are in progress. However, scale-out processes continue to occur, unless suspended, during a deployment. For more information, see Service auto scaling and deployments (p. 263).
· You can have multiple target tracking scaling policies for an Amazon ECS service, provided that each of them uses a different metric. The intention of Service Auto Scaling is to always prioritize availability, so its behavior differs depending on whether the target tracking policies are ready for scale out or scale in. It will scale out the service if any of the target tracking policies are ready for scale out, but will scale in only if all of the target tracking policies (with the scale-in portion enabled) are ready to scale in.
· Do not edit or delete the CloudWatch alarms that Service Auto Scaling manages for a target tracking scaling policy. Service Auto Scaling deletes the alarms automatically when you delete the scaling policy.
Tutorial: Service auto scaling with target tracking
The following procedures help you to create an Amazon ECS cluster and a service that uses target tracking to scale out (and in) automatically based on demand.
In this tutorial, you use the Amazon ECS first-run wizard to create a cluster and a service that runs behind an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer. Then you configure a target tracking scaling policy that scales your service automatically based on the current application load as measured by the service's CPU utilization (from the ECS, ClusterName, ServiceName category in CloudWatch).
When the average CPU utilization of your service rises above 75% (meaning that more than 75% of the CPU that is reserved for the service is being used), a scale-out alarm triggers Service Auto Scaling to add another task to your service to help out with the increased load. Conversely, when the average CPU utilization of your service drops below the target utilization for a sustained period of time, a scale-in alarm triggers a decrease in the service's desired count to free up those cluster resources for other tasks and services.
265

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Target tracking scaling policies
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you are using administrator credentials, and that you have an Amazon EC2 key pair in the current region. If you do not have these resources, or your are not sure, you can create them by following the steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4).
Step 1: Create a cluster and a service
Start by creating a cluster and service using the Amazon ECS first-run wizard. The first-run wizard takes care of creating the necessary IAM roles for this tutorial, an Auto Scaling group for your container instances, and a service that runs behind a load balancer. The wizard also makes the clean-up process much easier, because you can delete the entire AWS CloudFormation stack in one step.
For this tutorial, you create a cluster called service-autoscaling and a service called samplewebapp.
To create your cluster and service 1. Open the Amazon ECS console first run wizard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/
firstRun. 2. From the navigation bar, choose the US East (N. Virginia) region. 3. On Step 1: Container and Task, for Container definition, select sample-app. 4. For Task definition, leave all of the default options and choose Next. 5. On Step 2: Service, for Load balancer type, choose Application Load Balancer, Next.
Important Application Load Balancers do incur costs while they exist in your AWS resources. For more information, see Elastic Load Balancing Pricing. 6. On Step 3: Cluster, for Cluster name, enter service-autoscaling and choose Next. 7. Review your choices and then choose Create.
You are directed to a Launch Status page that shows the status of your launch and describes each step of the process (this can take a few minutes to complete while your cluster resources are created and populated). 8. When your cluster and service are created, choose View service.
Step 2: Configure service auto scaling
Now that you have launched a cluster and created a service in that cluster that is running behind a load balancer, you can use Service Auto Scaling by creating a target tracking scaling policy.
To configure basic Service Auto Scaling parameters 1. On the Service: sample-app-service page, your service configuration should look similar to the
image below, although the task definition revision and load balancer name are likely to be different. Choose Update to update your new service.
266

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Target tracking scaling policies
2. On the Update service page, choose Next step until you get to Step 3: Set Auto Scaling (optional). 3. For Service Auto Scaling, choose Configure Service Auto Scaling to adjust your service's desired
count. 4. For Minimum number of tasks, enter 1 for the lower limit of the number of tasks for Service Auto
Scaling to use. Your service's desired count is not automatically adjusted below this amount. 5. For Desired number of tasks, this field is pre-populated with the value that you entered earlier. This
value must be between the minimum and maximum number of tasks specified on this page. Leave this value at 1. 6. For Maximum number of tasks, enter 2 for the upper limit of the number of tasks for Service Auto Scaling to use. Your service's desired count is not automatically adjusted above this amount. 7. For IAM role for Service Auto Scaling, choose the ecsAutoscaleRole. If this role does not exist, choose Create new role to have the console create it for you. To configure a target tracking scaling policy for your service 1. Choose Add scaling policy to configure your scaling policy.
267

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Target tracking scaling policies
2. On the Add policy page, update the following fields:
a. For Scaling policy type, choose Target tracking. b. For Policy name, enter TargetTrackingPolicy. c. For ECS service metric, choose ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization. d. For Target value, enter 75. e. For Scale-out cooldown period, enter 60 seconds. A scale-out activity increases the number
of your service's tasks. While the scale-out cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous scale-out activity that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. f. For Scale-in cooldown period, enter 60 seconds. A scale-in activity reduces the number of your service's tasks. The scale-in cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale out activity during the cooldown period after a scalein, Service Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately. g. Choose Save. 3. Choose Next step. 4. Review all of your choices and then choose Update Service. 5. When your service status is finished updating, choose View Service.
Step 3: Trigger a scaling activity
After your service is configured with Service Auto Scaling, you can trigger a scaling activity by pushing your service's CPU utilization into the ALARM state. Because the example in this tutorial is a web application that is running behind a load balancer, you can send thousands of HTTP requests to your service (using the ApacheBench utility) to spike the service CPU utilization above the threshold amount. This spike should trigger the alarm, which in turn triggers a scaling activity to add one task to your service.
After the ApacheBench utility finishes the requests, the service CPU utilization should drop below your 75% threshold, triggering a scale-in activity that returns the service's desired count to 1.
To trigger a scaling activity for your service
1. From your service's main view page in the console, choose the load balancer name to view its details in the Amazon EC2 console. You need the load balancer's DNS name, which should look something like EC2Contai-EcsElast-SMAKV74U23PH-96652279.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
2. Use the ApacheBench (ab) utility to make thousands of HTTP requests to your load balancer in a short period of time. Note This command is installed by default on macOS, and it is available for many Linux distributions, as well. For example, you can install ab on Amazon Linux with the following command:
$ sudo yum install -y httpd24-tools
Run the following command, substituting your load balancer's DNS name.
$ ab -n 100000 -c 1000 http://EC2Contai-EcsElast-SMAKV74U23PH-96652279.useast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/
3. Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.
268

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step scaling policies
4. In the left navigation pane, choose Alarms. 5. Wait for your ab HTTP requests to trigger the scale-out alarm in the CloudWatch console. You
should see your Amazon ECS service scale out and add one task to your service's desired count. 6. Shortly after your ab HTTP requests complete (between 1 and 2 minutes), your scale in alarm should
trigger and the scale in policy reduces your service's desired count back to 1.
Step 4: Next steps
Go to the next step if you would like to delete the basic infrastructure that you just created for this tutorial. Otherwise, you can use this infrastructure as your base and try one or more of the following:
· To view these scaling activities from the Amazon ECS console, choose the Events tab of the service. When scaling events occur, you see informational messages here. For example:
Message: Successfully set desired count to 1. Change successfully fulfilled by ecs. Cause: monitor alarm TargetTracking-service/service-autoscaling/sample-webapp-AlarmLow-
fcd80aef-5161-4890-aeb4-35dde11ff42c in state ALARM triggered policy TargetTrackingPolicy
· If you have CloudWatch Container Insights set up and it's collecting Amazon ECS metrics, you can view metric data on the CloudWatch automatic dashboards. For more information, see Introducing Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon ECS in the AWS Compute Blog.
· Learn how to set up CloudWatch Container Insights. Additional charges apply. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308) and Updating cluster settings (p. 83).
Step 5: Cleaning up
When you have completed this tutorial, you may choose to keep your cluster, Auto Scaling group, load balancer, target tracking scaling policy, and CloudWatch alarms. However, if you are not actively using these resources, you should consider cleaning them up so that your account does not incur unnecessary charges.
To delete your cluster
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the left navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, choose the service-autoscaling cluster. 4. Choose Delete Cluster, Delete. It may take a few minutes for the cluster AWS CloudFormation stack
to finish cleaning up.
Step scaling policies
Although Amazon ECS service auto scaling supports using Application Auto Scaling step scaling policies, we recommend using target tracking scaling policies instead. For example, if you want to scale your service when CPU utilization falls below or rises above a certain level, create a target tracking scaling policy based on the CPU utilization metric provided by Amazon ECS. For more information, see Target tracking scaling policies (p. 265).
With step scaling policies, you create and manage the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process. If the target tracking alarms don't work for your use case, you can use step scaling. You can also use target tracking scaling with step scaling for an advanced scaling policy configuration. For example, you can configure a more aggressive response when utilization reaches a certain level.
269

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step scaling policies
Service Auto Scaling Considerations
When using scaling policies, note the following considerations:
· Amazon ECS sends metrics in 1-minute intervals to CloudWatch. Metrics are not available until the clusters and services send the metrics to CloudWatch, and you cannot create CloudWatch alarms for metrics that do not exist yet.
· The scaling policies support a cooldown period. This is the number of seconds to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect.
· For scale-out events, the intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. After Service Auto Scaling successfully scales out using a scaling policy, it starts to calculate the cooldown time. The scaling policy won't increase the desired capacity again unless either a larger scale out is triggered or the cooldown period ends. While the scale-out cooldown period is in effect, the capacity added by the initiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale-out activity.
· For scale-in events, the intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability, so scale-in activities are blocked until the cooldown period has expired. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out activity during the scale-in cooldown period, Service Auto Scaling scales out the target immediately. In this case, the scale-in cooldown period stops and doesn't complete.
· The ECS service scheduler respects the desired count at all times, but as long as you have active scaling policies and alarms on a service, Service Auto Scaling could change a desired count that was manually set by you.
· If a service's desired count is set below its minimum capacity value, and an alarm triggers a scale-out activity, Service Auto Scaling scales the desired count up to the minimum capacity value and then continues to scale out as required, based on the scaling policy associated with the alarm. However, a scale-in activity does not adjust the desired count, because it is already below the minimum capacity value.
· If a service's desired count is set above its maximum capacity value, and an alarm triggers a scale in activity, Service Auto Scaling scales the desired count out to the maximum capacity value and then continues to scale in as required, based on the scaling policy associated with the alarm. However, a scale-out activity does not adjust the desired count, because it is already above the maximum capacity value.
· During scaling activities, the actual running task count in a service is the value that Service Auto Scaling uses as its starting point, as opposed to the desired count. This is what processing capacity is supposed to be. This prevents excessive (runaway) scaling that might not be satisfied, for example, if there aren't enough container instance resources to place the additional tasks. If the container instance capacity is available later, the pending scaling activity may succeed, and then further scaling activities can continue after the cooldown period.
· If you want your task count to scale to zero when there's no work to be done, set a minimum capacity of 0. With target tracking scaling policies, when actual capacity is 0 and the metric indicates that there is workload demand, Service Auto Scaling waits for one data point to be sent before scaling out. In this case, it scales out by the minimum possible amount as a starting point and then resumes scaling based on the actual running task count.
· Application Auto Scaling disables scale-in processes while Amazon ECS deployments are in progress. However, scale-out processes continue to occur, unless suspended, during a deployment. For more information, see Service auto scaling and deployments (p. 263).
Amazon ECS console experience
Service Auto Scaling is off by default. You can turn it on by configuring scaling policies from the Auto Scaling tab of your services in the AWS Management Console for Amazon ECS.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service Discovery

For step-by-step guidance for working with scaling policies from the console, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226) and Updating a service (p. 237). For a target tracking walkthrough, see Target tracking scaling policies (p. 265).
When you configure scaling policies for a service in the Amazon ECS console, your service is automatically registered as a scalable target with Application Auto Scaling, and your scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created.
AWS CLI and SDK experience
Service Auto Scaling is made possible by a combination of the Amazon ECS, CloudWatch, and Application Auto Scaling APIs. Services are created and updated with Amazon ECS, alarms are created with CloudWatch, and scaling policies are created with Application Auto Scaling.
For more information about these specific API operations, see the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference, the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference, and the Application Auto Scaling API Reference. For more information about the AWS CLI commands for these services, see the ecs, cloudwatch, and application-autoscaling sections of the AWS CLI Command Reference.
To configure scaling policies for your Amazon ECS service using the AWS CLI
1. Register your ECS service as a scalable target using the register-scalable-target command. 2. Create a scaling policy using the put-scaling-policy command. 3. [Step scaling] Create an alarm that triggers the scaling policy using the put-metric-alarm command.
For more information about configuring scaling policies using the AWS CLI, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

Service Discovery
Amazon ECS services can be configured to use Service Discovery. Service discovery uses AWS Cloud Map API actions to manage HTTP and DNS namespaces for your Amazon ECS services. For more information, see What Is AWS Cloud Map? in the AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide.
When you create a private namespace in AWS Cloud Map, we automatically create a Route 53 hosted zone. The Amazon ECS service can register with a friendly and predictable DNS name in Amazon Route 53. The hosted zones are updated automatically as your Amazon ECS services scale up or down. Other services perform a DNS lookup to determine whether to make a connection to the service.
Service discovery is available in the following AWS Regions:

Region Name US East (N. Virginia) US East (Ohio) US West (N. California) US West (Oregon) Africa (Cape Town) Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

Region us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2 af-south-1 ap-east-1 ap-south-1

Service Discovery concepts
Service discovery consists of the following components:
· Service discovery namespace: A logical group of service discovery services that share the same domain name, such as example.com. This is the domain name where you want to route traffic to. You can create a namespace with a call to the aws servicediscovery createprivate-dns-namespace command or in the Amazon ECS classic console. You can use the aws servicediscovery list-namespaces command to view the summary information about the namespaces that were created by the current account. For more information about the service discovery commands, see create-private-dns-namespace and list-namespaces in the AWS Cloud Map (service discovery) AWS CLI Reference Guide.
· Service discovery service: Exists within the service discovery namespace and consists of the service name and DNS configuration for the namespace. It provides the following core component:
· Service registry: Allows you to look up a service via DNS or AWS Cloud Map API actions and get back one or more available endpoints that can be used to connect to the service.
· Service discovery instance: Exists within the service discovery service and consists of the attributes that are associated with each Amazon ECS service in the service directory.
· Instance attributes: The following metadata is added as custom attributes for each Amazon ECS service that's configured to use service discovery:
272

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service discovery considerations
· AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 ­ For an A record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries and AWS Cloud Map returns when discovering instance details, for example, 192.0.2.44.
· AWS_INSTANCE_PORT ­ The port value that's associated with the service discovery service. · AVAILABILITY_ZONE ­ The Availability Zone that the task was launched into. For tasks that use
the EC2 launch type, this is the Availability Zone where the container instance is in. For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, this is the Availability Zone where the elastic network interface is in. · REGION ­ The Region where the task is in. · ECS_SERVICE_NAME ­ The name of the Amazon ECS service that the task belongs to. · ECS_CLUSTER_NAME ­ The name of the Amazon ECS cluster that the task belongs to. · EC2_INSTANCE_ID ­ The ID of the container instance the task was placed on. This custom attribute isn't added if the task is using the Fargate launch type. · ECS_TASK_DEFINITION_FAMILY ­ The task definition family that the task is using. · ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID ­ If a task set is created for an external deployment and is associated with a service discovery registry, then the ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID attribute contains the external ID of the task set. · Amazon ECS health checks: Amazon ECS performs periodic container-level health checks. If an endpoint doesn't pass the health check, it's removed from DNS routing and marked as unhealthy.
Service discovery considerations
The following should be considered when using service discovery:
· Service discovery is supported for tasks on Fargate that use platform version 1.1.0 or later. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
· Services configured to use service discovery have a limit of 1,000 tasks for each service. This is due to a Route 53 service quota.
· The Create Service workflow in the Amazon ECS classic console only supports registering services into private DNS namespaces. When an AWS Cloud Map private DNS namespace is created, a Route 53 private hosted zone will be created automatically.
· The VPC DNS attributes must be configured for successful DNS resolution. For information about how to configure the attributes, see DNS support in your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
· The DNS records created for a service discovery service always register with the private IP address for the task, rather than the public IP address, even when public namespaces are used.
· Service discovery requires that tasks specify either the awsvpc, bridge, or host network mode (none is not supported).
· If the service task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, you can create any combination of A or SRV records for each service task. If you use SRV records, a port is required.
· If the service task definition uses the bridge or host network mode, the SRV record is the only supported DNS record type. Create a SRV record for each service task. The SRV record must specify a container name and container port combination from the task definition.
· DNS records for a service discovery service can be queried within your VPC. They use the following format: <service discovery service name>.<service discovery namespace>.
· When doing a DNS query on the service name, A records return a set of IP addresses that correspond to your tasks. SRV records return a set of IP addresses and ports for each task.
· If you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all of the healthy records.
· When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records. · You can configure service discovery for an ECS service that's behind a load balancer, but service
discovery traffic is always routed to the task and not the load balancer.
273

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Amazon ECS classic console experience
· Service discovery doesn't support the use of Classic Load Balancers. · We recommend you use container-level health checks managed by Amazon ECS for your service
discovery service. · HealthCheckCustomConfig--Amazon ECS manages health checks on your behalf. Amazon ECS uses
information from container and health checks, and your task state, to update the health with AWS Cloud Map. This is specified using the --health-check-custom-config parameter when creating your service discovery service. For more information, see HealthCheckCustomConfig in the AWS Cloud Map API Reference. · If you're using the Amazon ECS classic console, the workflow creates one service discovery service for each ECS service. It maps all of the task IP addresses as A records, or task IP addresses and port as SRV records. · Service discovery can only be configured when first creating a service. Updating existing services to configure service discovery for the first time or change the current configuration isn't supported. · The AWS Cloud Map resources created when service discovery is used must be cleaned up manually.
Amazon ECS classic console experience
The workflow to create a service in the Amazon ECS classic console supports service discovery. Service discovery can only be configured when first creating a service. Updating existing services to configure service discovery for the first time or change the current configuration isn't supported.
To create a new Amazon ECS service that uses service discovery, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226).
Service discovery pricing
Customers using Amazon ECS service discovery are charged for Route 53 resources and AWS Cloud Map discovery API operations. This involves costs for creating the Route 53 hosted zones and queries to the service registry. For more information, see AWS Cloud Map Pricing in the AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide.
Amazon ECS performs container level health checks and exposes them to AWS Cloud Map custom health check API operations. This is currently made available to customers at no extra cost. If you configure additional network health checks for publicly exposed tasks, you're charged for those health checks.
Service throttle logic
The Amazon ECS service scheduler includes logic that throttles how often service tasks are launched if they repeatedly fail to start.
If tasks for an ECS service repeatedly fail to enter the RUNNING state (progressing directly from a PENDING to a STOPPED status), then the time between subsequent restart attempts is incrementally increased up to a maximum of 15 minutes. This maximum period is subject to change in the future. This behavior reduces the effect that unstartable tasks have on your Amazon ECS cluster resources or Fargate infrastructure costs. If your service initiates the throttle logic, you receive the following service event message (p. 452):
(service service-name) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully.
Amazon ECS doesn't ever stop a failing service from retrying. It also doesn't attempt to modify it in any way other than increasing the time between restarts. The service throttle logic doesn't provide any usertunable parameters.
274

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service throttle logic
If you update your service to use a new task definition, your service returns to a normal, non-throttled state immediately. For more information, see Updating a service (p. 237). The following are some common causes that trigger this logic: · The Amazon ECS container agent can't pull your task Docker image. This might be because a bad
container image name, image, or tag, or a lack of private registry authentication or permissions. In this case, you also see CannotPullContainerError in your stopped task errors (p. 442).
Important Tasks that are stopped after they reach the RUNNING state don't start the throttle logic or the associated service event message. For example, assume that failed Elastic Load Balancing health checks for a service cause a task to be flagged as unhealthy, and Amazon ECS deregisters it and stops the task. At this point, the tasks aren't throttled. Even if a task's container command immediately exits with a non-zero exit code, the task already moved to the RUNNING state. Tasks that fail immediately because command errors don't cause the throttle or the service event message.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tagging your resources
Resources and tags
Amazon ECS resources, including task definitions, clusters, tasks, services, and container instances, are assigned an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and a unique resource identifier (ID). These resources can be tagged with values that you define, to help you organize and identify them.
The following topics provide an overview on these resources and tags and show how you can use them.
Contents · Tagging your Amazon ECS resources (p. 276) · Amazon ECS service quotas (p. 281) · Supported Regions for Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate (p. 285) · Amazon ECS usage reports (p. 287)
Tagging your Amazon ECS resources
To help you manage your Amazon ECS resources, you can optionally assign your own metadata to each resource using tags. This topic provides an overview of tags in Amazon ECS and how you can create them.
To use this feature, you must opt in to the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource identifier (ID) formats. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs (p. 197).
Important Do not add personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. Tags are accessible to many AWS services, including billing. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.
Tag basics
A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. This is useful when you have many resources of the same type. You can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it. For example, you can define a set of tags for your account's Amazon ECS container instances to help you track each instance's owner and stack level.
We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add.
Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon ECS and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. Also, tags are not automatically assigned to your resources. You can edit tag keys and values, and you can remove tags from a resource at any time. You can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. If you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag on that resource, the new value overwrites the earlier value. If you delete a resource, any tags for the resource are also deleted.
276

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tagging your resources

You can work with tags using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, and the Amazon ECS API.
If you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can control which users in your AWS account have permission to manage tags.
Tagging your resources

You can tag new or existing Amazon ECS tasks, services, task definitions, and clusters.
Important Do not add personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. Tags are accessible to many AWS services, including billing. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.

If you're using the Amazon ECS console, you can apply tags to new or existing resources by using the Tags tab on the relevant resource page at any time. When you use the Amazon ECS-managed tags option (the Propagate tags from option), tags are copied from the task definition or service to a task. This can be done when you're running a task or creating a service.

If you're using the Amazon ECS API, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK, you can apply tags to new
resources using the tags parameter on the relevant API action. Or, alternatively, you can use the TagResource API action to apply tags to existing resources. For more information, see TagResource. The propagateTags parameter can be used to copy tags from the task definition or service to the task. This
can be done when you're running a task or creating a service. For more information, see RunTask and
CreateService.

Additionally, some resource-creating actions enable you to specify tags for a resource when the resource is created. If tags can't be applied while resources are being created, we roll back the process of creating resources. This ensures that resources are either created with tags or not created at all, and that no resources are left untagged at any time. By tagging resources while they're being created, you can eliminate the need to run custom tagging scripts after resource creation.

When you use the ECS managed tags option, Amazon ECS automatically propagates tags to your tasks from either your task definition or your service.

The following table describes the Amazon ECS resources that can be tagged, and the resources that can be tagged when created.

Tag restrictions
The following basic restrictions apply to tags
· Maximum number of tags per resource ­ 50 · For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. · Maximum key length ­ 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8 · Maximum value length ­ 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8 · If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services
may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. · Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. · Don't use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values. These are reserved only for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
Tagging your resources for billing
When you use Amazon ECS-managed tags, Amazon ECS automatically tags all newly launched tasks with the cluster name. For tasks that belong to a service, they are also tagged with the service name. These managed tags are helpful when reviewing cost allocation after enabling them in your Cost and Usage Report. For more information, see Amazon ECS usage reports (p. 287).
To see the cost of your combined resources, you can organize your billing information based on resources that have the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several

services. For more information about setting up a cost allocation report with tags, see The Monthly Cost Allocation Report in the AWS Billing User Guide.
Important To use this feature, you must opt in to the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource identifier (ID) formats. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs (p. 197).
Note If you've enabled reporting, data for the current month is available for viewing after 24 hours.
Working with tags using the console
Using the Amazon ECS console, you can manage the tags associated with new or existing tasks, services, task definitions, clusters, or container instances.
When you select a resource-specific page in the Amazon ECS console, it displays a list of those resources. For example, if you select Clusters from the navigation pane, the console displays a list of Amazon ECS clusters. When you select a resource from one of these lists (for example, a specific cluster) that supports tags, you can view and manage its tags on the Tags tab.
Important Do not add personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. Tags are accessible to many AWS services, including billing. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.

Amazon ECS usage reports
AWS provides a free reporting tool called Cost Explorer that enables you to analyze the cost and usage of your Amazon ECS resources.
Cost Explorer is a free tool that you can use to view charts of your usage and costs. You can view data from the last 13 months, and forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next three months. You can use Cost Explorer to see patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time. For example, you can use it to identify areas that need further inquiry and see trends that you can use to understand your costs. You also can specify time ranges for the data, and view time data by day or by month.
The metering data in your Cost and Usage Report shows usage across all of your Amazon ECS tasks. The metering data includes CPU usage as vCPU-Hours and memory usage as GB-Hours for each task that was run. How that data is presented depends on the launch type of the task.
For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the lineItem/Operation column shows FargateTask and you will see the cost associated with each task.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Usage Reports
You can also use the Amazon ECS-managed tags to identify the service or cluster that each task belongs to. For more information, see Tagging your resources for billing (p. 278).
Important The metering data is only viewable for tasks launched on or after November 16, 2018. Tasks launched before this date don't show metering data. Here's an example of some of the fields you can sort cost allocation data by using Cost Explorer. · Cluster name · Service name · Resource tags · Launch type · Region · Usage type For more information about creating an AWS Cost and Usage Report, see AWS Cost and Usage Report in the AWS Billing User Guide.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Monitoring tools
Monitoring Amazon ECS
You can monitor your Amazon ECS resources using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon ECS into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your clusters or services are performing. Amazon ECS metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in 1-minute periods. For more information about CloudWatch, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon ECS and your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. Before you start monitoring Amazon ECS; however, you should create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:
· What are your monitoring goals? · What resources will you monitor? · How often will you monitor these resources? · What monitoring tools will you use? · Who will perform the monitoring tasks? · Who should be notified when something goes wrong?
When you are using the Fargate launch type, you get CPU and memory utilization metrics for each of your services to assist in the monitoring of your environment.
The next step is to establish a baseline for normal Amazon ECS performance in your environment, by measuring performance at various times and under different load conditions. As you monitor Amazon ECS, store historical monitoring data so that you can compare it with current performance data, identify normal performance patterns and performance anomalies, and devise methods to address issues.

Monitoring tools
AWS provides various tools that you can use to monitor Amazon ECS. You can configure some of these tools to do the monitoring for you, while some of the tools require manual intervention. We recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as possible.
Automated monitoring tools
You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch Amazon ECS and report when something is wrong:

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Manual Tools
· Amazon CloudWatch alarms ­ Watch a single metric over a time period that you specify, and perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch metrics (p. 290).
For services with tasks that use the Fargate launch type, you can use CloudWatch alarms to scale in and scale out the tasks in your service based on CloudWatch metrics, such as CPU and memory utilization. For more information, see Service auto scaling (p. 263). · Amazon CloudWatch Logs ­ Monitor, store, and access the log files from the containers in your Amazon ECS tasks by specifying the awslogs log driver in your task definitions. For more information, see Using the awslogs log driver (p. 138). · Amazon CloudWatch Events ­ Match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams to make changes, capture state information, and take corrective action. For more information, see Amazon ECS events and EventBridge (p. 297) in this guide and What Is Amazon CloudWatch Events? in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. · AWS CloudTrail log monitoring ­ Share log files between accounts, monitor CloudTrail log files in real time by sending them to CloudWatch Logs, write log processing applications in Java, and validate that your log files have not changed after delivery by CloudTrail. For more information, see Logging Amazon ECS API calls with AWS CloudTrail (p. 317) in this guide, and Working with CloudTrail Log Files in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
Manual monitoring tools
Another important part of monitoring Amazon ECS involves manually monitoring those items that the CloudWatch alarms don't cover. The CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor, and other AWS console dashboards provide an at-a-glance view of the state of your AWS environment. We recommend that you also check the log files on your container instances and the containers in your tasks.
· CloudWatch home page: · Current alarms and status · Graphs of alarms and resources · Service health status
In addition, you can use CloudWatch to do the following: · Create customized dashboards to monitor the services you care about. · Graph metric data to troubleshoot issues and discover trends. · Search and browse all your AWS resource metrics. · Create and edit alarms to be notified of problems. · AWS Trusted Advisor can help you monitor your AWS resources to improve performance, reliability, security, and cost effectiveness. Four Trusted Advisor checks are available to all users; more than 50 checks are available to users with a Business or Enterprise support plan. For more information, see AWS Trusted Advisor.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Enabling CloudWatch metrics
Amazon ECS collects metrics for clusters and services. You must enable Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights for per-task metrics, including CPU and memory utilization. For more information about Container Insights, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
Topics · Enabling CloudWatch metrics (p. 291) · Available metrics and dimensions (p. 291) · Service utilization (p. 293) · Service RUNNING task count (p. 294) · Viewing Amazon ECS metrics (p. 295)
Enabling CloudWatch metrics
Any Amazon ECS service using the Fargate launch type is enabled for CloudWatch CPU and memory utilization metrics automatically, so you don't need to take any manual steps.
Available metrics and dimensions
The following sections list the metrics and dimensions that Amazon ECS sends to Amazon CloudWatch.
Amazon ECS metrics
Amazon ECS provides metrics for you to monitor your resources. You can measure the CPU and memory reservation and utilization across your cluster as a whole, and the CPU and memory utilization on the services in your clusters. For your GPU workloads, you can measure your GPU reservation across your cluster.
The metrics made available will depend on the launch type of the tasks and services in your clusters. If you're using the Fargate launch type for your services, CPU and memory utilization metrics are provided to assist in the monitoring of your services. For the EC2 launch type, Amazon ECS provides CPU, memory, and GPU reservation and CPU and memory utilization metrics at the cluster and service level. You need to monitor the Amazon EC2 instances that make your underlying infrastructure separately.
Amazon ECS sends the following metrics to CloudWatch every minute. When Amazon ECS collects metrics, it collects multiple data points every minute. It then aggregates them to one data point before sending the data to CloudWatch. So in CloudWatch, one sample count is actually the aggregate of multiple data points during one minute.
The AWS/ECS namespace includes the following metrics.
CPUReservation
The percentage of CPU units that are reserved by running tasks in the cluster.
Cluster CPU reservation (this metric can only be filtered by ClusterName) is measured as the total CPU units that are reserved by Amazon ECS tasks on the cluster, divided by the total CPU units that were registered for all of the container instances in the cluster. Only container instances in ACTIVE or DRAINING status will affect CPU reservation metrics. This metric is only used for tasks using the EC2 launch type.
Valid dimensions: ClusterName.
Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Sample Count. The most useful statistic is Average.
Unit: Percent.
291

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Available metrics and dimensions
CPUUtilization
The percentage of CPU units that are used in the cluster or service.
Cluster CPU utilization (metrics that are filtered by ClusterName without ServiceName) is measured as the total CPU units in use by Amazon ECS tasks on the cluster, divided by the total CPU units that were registered for all of the container instances in the cluster. Only container instances in ACTIVE or DRAINING status will affect CPU utilization metrics. Cluster CPU utilization metrics are only used for tasks using the EC2 launch type.
Service CPU utilization (metrics that are filtered by ClusterName and ServiceName) is measured as the total CPU units in use by the tasks that belong to the service, divided by the total number of CPU units that are reserved for the tasks that belong to the service. Service CPU utilization metrics are used for tasks using both the Fargate and the EC2 launch type.
Valid dimensions: ClusterName, ServiceName.
Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Sample Count. The most useful statistic is Average.
Unit: Percent. MemoryReservation
The percentage of memory that is reserved by running tasks in the cluster.
Cluster memory reservation (this metric can only be filtered by ClusterName) is measured as the total memory that is reserved by Amazon ECS tasks on the cluster, divided by the total amount of memory that was registered for all of the container instances in the cluster. Only container instances in ACTIVE or DRAINING status will affect memory reservation metrics. This metric is only used for tasks using the EC2 launch type.
Valid dimensions: ClusterName.
Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Sample Count. The most useful statistic is Average.
Unit: Percent. MemoryUtilization
The percentage of memory that is used in the cluster or service.
Cluster memory utilization (metrics that are filtered by ClusterName without ServiceName) is measured as the total memory in use by Amazon ECS tasks on the cluster, divided by the total amount of memory that was registered for all of the container instances in the cluster. Only container instances in ACTIVE or DRAINING status will affect memory utilization metrics. Cluster memory utilization metrics are only used for tasks using the EC2 launch type.
Service memory utilization (metrics that are filtered by ClusterName and ServiceName) is measured as the total memory in use by the tasks that belong to the service, divided by the total memory that is reserved for the tasks that belong to the service. Service memory utilization metrics are used for tasks using both the Fargate and EC2 launch types.
Valid dimensions: ClusterName, ServiceName.
Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Sample Count. The most useful statistic is Average.
Unit: Percent. GPUReservation
The percentage of total available GPUs that are reserved by running tasks in the cluster.
292

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service utilization
Cluster GPU reservation is measured as the number of GPUs reserved by Amazon ECS tasks on the cluster, divided by the total number of GPUs that was available on all of the GPU-enabled container instances in the cluster. Only container instances in ACTIVE or DRAINING status will affect GPU reservation metrics.
Valid dimensions: ClusterName.
Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Sample Count. The most useful statistic is Average.
Unit: Percent.
Note If you're using tasks with the EC2 launch type and have Linux container instances, the Amazon ECS container agent relies on Docker stats metrics to gather CPU and memory data for each container running on the instance. For burstable performance instances (T3, T3a, and T2 instances), the CPU utilization metric may reflect different data compared to instance-level CPU metrics.
Dimensions for Amazon ECS metrics
Amazon ECS metrics use the AWS/ECS namespace and provide metrics for the following dimensions. Metrics for a dimension only reflect the resources with running tasks during a period. For example, if you have a cluster with one service in it but that service has no tasks in a RUNNING state, there will be no metrics sent to CloudWatch. If you have two services and one of them has running tasks and the other doesn't, only the metrics for the service with running tasks would be sent.
ClusterName
This dimension filters the data that you request for all resources in a specified cluster. All Amazon ECS metrics are filtered by ClusterName. ServiceName
This dimension filters the data that you request for all resources in a specified service within a specified cluster.
Service utilization
Service utilization is measured as the percentage of CPU and memory that is used by the Amazon ECS tasks that belong to a service on a cluster when compared to the CPU and memory that is specified in the service's task definition. This metric is supported for services with tasks using the Fargate launch type.
(Total CPU units used by tasks in service) x 100 Service CPU utilization =
---------------------------------------------------------------------------(Total CPU units specified in task definition) x (number of
tasks in service)
(Total MiB of memory used by tasks in service) x 100 Service memory utilization = --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Total MiB of memory specified in task definition) x (number of tasks in service)
293

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service RUNNING task count
Each minute, the Amazon ECS container agent associated with each task calculates the number of CPU units and MiB of memory that are currently being used for each task owned by the service, and this information is reported back to Amazon ECS. The total amount of CPU and memory used for all tasks owned by the service that are running on the cluster is calculated, and those numbers are reported to CloudWatch as a percentage of the total resources that are specified for the service in the service's task definition. If you specify a soft limit (memoryReservation), it's used to calculate the amount of reserved memory. Otherwise, the hard limit (memory) is used. For more information about hard and soft limits, see Task Definition Parameters.
Note In this example, the CPU utilization will only go above 100% when the CPU units are defined at the container level. If you define CPU units at the task level, the utilization will not go above the defined task-level limit.
Service RUNNING task count
You can use CloudWatch metrics to view the number of tasks in your services that are in the RUNNING state. For example, you can set a CloudWatch alarm for this metric to alert you if the number of running tasks in your service falls below a specified value.
Service RUNNING task count in Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights
A "Number of Running Tasks" (RunningTaskCount) metric is available per cluster and per service when you use Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights. You can use Container Insights for all new clusters created by opting in to the containerInsights account setting, on individual clusters by enabling it using the cluster settings during cluster creation, or on existing clusters by using the UpdateClusterSettings API. Metrics collected by CloudWatch Container Insights are charged as custom metrics. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see CloudWatch Pricing.
To view this metric, see Amazon ECS Container Insights Metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Service RUNNING task count from Amazon ECS provided metrics
However Amazon ECS provides monitoring metrics at no additional cost. To use these metrics to count the running tasks, follow the steps below in the CloudWatch console.
To view the number of running tasks in a service
1. Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/. 2. On the navigation pane, choose Metrics, All metrics. 3. On the Browse tab, choose the ECS namespace. 4. Choose ClusterName, ServiceName and then choose any metric (either CPUUtilization or

The class of resource being tracked. Currently, AWS Fargate does not use the class dimension.

Creating a CloudWatch alarm to monitor Fargate resource usage metrics
AWS Fargate provides CloudWatch usage metrics that correspond to the AWS service quotas for Fargate On-Demand and Fargate Spot resource usage. In the Service Quotas console, you can visualize your usage on a graph and configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information, see AWS Fargate usage metrics (p. 296).
Use the following steps to create a CloudWatch alarm based on one of the Fargate resource usage metrics.
To create an alarm based on your Fargate usage quotas (AWS Management Console)
1. Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose AWS services. 3. From the AWS services list, search for and select AWS Fargate. 4. In the Service quotas list, select the Fargate usage quota you want to create an alarm for. 5. In the Amazon CloudWatch Events alarms section, choose Create. 6. For Alarm threshold, choose the percentage of your applied quota value that you want to set as the
alarm value. 7. For Alarm name, enter a name for the alarm and then choose Create.
Amazon ECS events and EventBridge
Amazon EventBridge enables you to automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near real time. You can write simple rules to indicate which events are of interest to you and what automated actions to take when an event matches a rule. The actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:
· Adding events to log groups in CloudWatch Logs · Invoking an AWS Lambda function

297

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Amazon ECS events
· Invoking Amazon EC2 Run Command · Relaying the event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams · Activating an AWS Step Functions state machine · Notifying an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue
For more information, see Getting Started with Amazon EventBridge in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
You can use Amazon ECS events for EventBridge to receive near real-time notifications regarding the current state of your Amazon ECS clusters. When using the Fargate launch type, you can see the state of your tasks. For services, you can see events related to the health of your service.
Using EventBridge, you can build custom schedulers on top of Amazon ECS that are responsible for orchestrating tasks across clusters and monitoring the state of clusters in near real time. You can eliminate scheduling and monitoring code that continuously polls the Amazon ECS service for status changes and instead handle Amazon ECS state changes asynchronously using any EventBridge target. Targets might include AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service, or Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
An Amazon ECS event stream ensures that every event is delivered at least one time. If duplicate events are sent, the event provides enough information to identify duplicates. For more information, see Handling events (p. 306).
Events are relatively ordered, so that you can easily tell when an event occurred in relation to other events.
Topics · Amazon ECS events (p. 298) · Handling events (p. 306)
Amazon ECS events
Amazon ECS tracks the state of each of your tasks and services. If the state of a task or service changes, an event is triggered and is sent to Amazon EventBridge. These events are classified as task state change events and service action events. These events and their possible causes are described in greater detail in the following sections.
Note Amazon ECS may add other event types, sources, and details in the future. If you are programmatically deserializing event JSON data, make sure that your application is prepared to handle unknown properties to avoid issues if and when these additional properties are added.
Container state change and task state change events contain two version fields: one in the main body of the event, and one in the detail object of the event. The following describes the differences between these two fields:
· The version field in the main body of the event is set to 0 on all events. For more information about EventBridge parameters, see Events and Event Patterns in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
· The version field in the detail object of the event describes the version of the associated resource. Each time a resource changes state, this version is incremented. Because events can be sent multiple times, this field allows you to identify duplicate events. Duplicate events have the same version in the detail object. If you are replicating your task state with EventBridge, you can compare the version of a resource reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported in EventBridge for the resource (inside the detail object) to verify that the version in your event stream is current.
298

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Amazon ECS events
Service action events only contain the version field in the main body.
Task state change events
The following scenarios trigger task state change events:
You call the StartTask, RunTask, or StopTask API operations, either directly or with the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
Starting or stopping tasks creates new task resources or modifies the state of existing task resources. The Amazon ECS service scheduler starts or stops a task.
Starting or stopping tasks creates new task resources or modifies the state of existing task resources. The Amazon ECS container agent calls the SubmitTaskStateChange API operation.
The Amazon ECS container agent monitors the state of your tasks and it reports any state changes. State changes might include changes from PENDING to RUNNING or from RUNNING to STOPPED.
A container in the task changes state.
The Amazon ECS container agent monitors the state of containers within tasks. For example, if a container that is running within a task stops, this container state change triggers an event. A task using the Fargate Spot capacity provider receives a termination notice.
When a task is using the FARGATE_SPOT capacity provider and is stopped due to a Spot interruption, a task state change event is triggered.
Example Task state change event
Task state change events are delivered in the following format. The detail section below resembles the Task object that is returned from a DescribeTasks API operation in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference. If your containers are using an image hosted with Amazon ECR, the imageDigest field is returned.
Note The values for the createdAt, connectivityAt, pullStartedAt, startedAt, pullStoppedAt, and updatedAt fields are UNIX timestamps in the response of a DescribeTasks action whereas in the task state change event they are ISO string timestamps.
For more information about CloudWatch Events parameters, see Events and Event Patterns in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.

Amazon ECS sends events with INFO, WARN, and ERROR event types. The following are the service action events.
Service action events with INFO event type
SERVICE_STEADY_STATE
The service is healthy and at the desired number of tasks, thus reaching a steady state. The service scheduler reports the status periodically, so you might receive this message multiple times. TASKSET_STEADY_STATE
The task set is healthy and at the desired number of tasks, thus reaching a steady state. CAPACITY_PROVIDER_STEADY_STATE
A capacity provider associated with a service reaches a steady state. SERVICE_DESIRED_COUNT_UPDATED
When the service scheduler updates the computed desired count for a service or task set. This event is not sent when the desired count is manually updated by a user.
Service action events with WARN event type
SERVICE_TASK_START_IMPAIRED
The service is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. SERVICE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE_UNHEALTHY
A service using service discovery contains an unhealthy task. The service scheduler detects that a task within a service registry is unhealthy.

Service action events with ERROR event type
SERVICE_DAEMON_PLACEMENT_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATED
A task in a service using the DAEMON service scheduler strategy no longer meets the placement constraint strategy for the service. ECS_OPERATION_THROTTLED
The service scheduler has been throttled due to the Amazon ECS API throttle limits. SERVICE_DISCOVERY_OPERATION_THROTTLED
The service scheduler has been throttled due to the AWS Cloud Map API throttle limits. This can occur on services configured to use service discovery. SERVICE_TASK_PLACEMENT_FAILURE
The service scheduler is unable to place a task. The cause will be described in the reason field.
A common cause for this service event being triggered is because of a lack of resources in the cluster to place the task. For example, not enough CPU or memory capacity on the available container instances or no container instances being available. Another common cause is when the Amazon ECS container agent is disconnected on the container instance, causing the scheduler to be unable to place the task. SERVICE_TASK_CONFIGURATION_FAILURE
The service scheduler is unable to place a task due to a configuration error. The cause will be described in the reason field.
A common cause of this service event being triggered is because tags were being applied to the service but the user or role had not opted in to the new Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format in the Region. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs (p. 197). Another common cause is that Amazon ECS was unable to assume the task IAM role provided.

For more information, see Creating an EventBridge Rule in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
{ "source": [ "aws.ecs" ], "detail-type": [ "ECS Deployment State Change" ]
}
Amazon ECS sends events with INFO and ERROR event types. The following are the service deployment state change events.
304

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Amazon ECS events
SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS
The service deployment is in progress. This event is sent for both initial deployments and rollback deployments.
SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETED
The service deployment has completed. This event is sent once a service reaches a steady state after a deployment.
SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_FAILED
The service deployment has failed. This event is sent for services with deployment circuit breaker logic enabled.
Example service deployment in progress event
Service deployment in progress events are delivered when both an initial and a rollback deployment is started. The difference between the two is in the reason field. For more information about EventBridge parameters, see Events and Event Patterns in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
The following shows an example output for an initial deployment starting.

}
Handling events
Amazon ECS sends events on an at least once basis. This means you may receive multiple copies of a given event. Additionally, events may not be delivered to your event listeners in the order in which the events occurred.
306

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Handling events
To enable proper ordering of events, the detail section of each event contains a version property. Each time a resource changes state, this version is incremented. Duplicate events have the same version in the detail object. If you are replicating your task state with EventBridge, you can compare the version of a resource reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported in EventBridge for the resource to verify that the version in your event stream is current. Events with a higher version property number should be treated as occurring later than events with lower version numbers.
Example: Handling events in an AWS Lambda function
The following example shows a Lambda function written in Python 2.7 that captures task state change events and saves them to the following Amazon DynamoDB table:
· ECSTaskState ­ Stores the latest state for a task. The table ID is the taskArn value of the task.
import json import boto3
def lambda_handler(event, context): id_name = "" new_record = {}
# For debugging so you can see raw event format. print('Here is the event:') print(json.dumps(event))
if event["source"] != "aws.ecs": raise ValueError("Function only supports input from events with a source type of:
aws.ecs")
# Switch on task/container events. table_name = "" if event["detail-type"] == "ECS Task State Change":
table_name = "ECSTaskState" id_name = "taskArn" event_id = event["detail"]["taskArn"] else: raise ValueError("detail-type for event is not a supported type. Exiting without saving event.")
new_record["cw_version"] = event["version"] new_record.update(event["detail"])
# "status" is a reserved word in DDB, but it appears in containerPort # state change messages. if "status" in event:
new_record["current_status"] = event["status"] new_record.pop("status")
# Look first to see if you have received a newer version of an event ID. # If the version is OLDER than what you have on file, do not process it. # Otherwise, update the associated record with this latest information. print("Looking for recent event with same ID...") dynamodb = boto3.resource("dynamodb", region_name="us-east-1") table = dynamodb.Table(table_name) saved_event = table.get_item(
Key={ id_name : event_id
} ) if "Item" in saved_event:
# Compare events and reconcile.
307

print("EXISTING EVENT DETECTED: Id " + event_id + " - reconciling") if saved_event["Item"]["version"] < event["detail"]["version"]:
print("Received event is a more recent version than the stored event updating")
table.put_item( Item=new_record

Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights
CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. The metrics are available in CloudWatch automatic dashboards. For a full list of Amazon ECS Container Insights metrics, see Amazon ECS Container Insights Metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Operational data is collected as performance log events. These are entries that use a structured JSON schema that enables high-cardinality data to be ingested and stored at scale. From this data, CloudWatch creates higher-level aggregated metrics at the cluster, service, and task level as CloudWatch metrics. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Insights metrics; in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Important Metrics collected by CloudWatch Container Insights are charged as custom metrics. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see CloudWatch Pricing. Amazon ECS also provides monitoring metrics that are provided at no additional cost. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch metrics (p. 290).
Container Insights considerations
The following should be considered when using CloudWatch Container Insights.
· CloudWatch Container Insights metrics only reflect the resources with running tasks during the specified time range. For example, if you have a cluster with one service in it but that service has no tasks in a RUNNING state, there will be no metrics sent to CloudWatch. If you have two services and one of them has running tasks and the other doesn't, only the metrics for the service with running tasks will be sent.
· Network metrics are available for all tasks run on Fargate and tasks run on Amazon EC2 instances that use either the bridge or awsvpc network modes.
Setting up CloudWatch Container Insights for cluster and service level metrics
Container Insights can be enabled for all new clusters created by opting in to the containerInsights account setting, on individual clusters by enabling it using the cluster settings during cluster creation, or on existing clusters by using the UpdateClusterSettings API.
308

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Setting up CloudWatch Container Insights
for cluster and service level metrics
Opting in to the containerInsights account setting can be done with both the Amazon ECS console and the AWS CLI. You must be running version 1.16.200 or later of the AWS CLI to use this feature. For more information on creating Amazon ECS clusters, see Creating a cluster using the classic console (p. 77).
Important
To opt in all IAM users or roles on your account to Container Insights-enabled clusters using the console
1. As the root user of the account, open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ ecs/.
2. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, select the Region for which to opt in to Container Insights-enabled clusters.
3. From the dashboard, choose Account Settings. 4. For IAM user or role, ensure your root user or container instance IAM role is selected. 5. For Container Insights, select the check box. Choose Save once finished.
Important IAM users and IAM roles need the ecs:PutAccountSetting permission to perform this action. 6. On the confirmation screen, choose Confirm to save the selection.
To opt in all IAM users or roles on your account to Container Insights-enabled clusters using the command line
Any user on an account can use one of the following commands to modify the default account setting for all IAM users or roles on your account. These changes apply to the entire AWS account unless an IAM user or role explicitly overrides these settings for themselves.
· put-account-setting-default (AWS CLI)
aws ecs put-account-setting-default --name containerInsights --value enabled --region useast-1
· Write-ECSAccountSettingDefault (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
Write-ECSAccountSettingDefault -Name containerInsights -Value enabled -Region us-east-1 Force
To opt in an IAM user or container instance IAM role to Container Insights-enabled clusters as the root user using the command line
The root user on an account can use one of the following commands and specify the ARN of the principal IAM user or container instance IAM role in the request to modify the account settings.
· put-account-setting (AWS CLI)
The following example is for modifying the account setting of a specific IAM user:
aws ecs put-account-setting --name containerInsights --value enabled --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:user/userName --region us-east-1
· Write-ECSAccountSetting (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
The following example is for modifying the account setting of a specific IAM user:

Use one of the following commands to update the setting for a cluster.
· update-cluster-settings (AWS CLI)
aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster cluster_name_or_arn --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled|disabled --region us-east-1
Collecting application trace data
Amazon ECS integrates with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to collect trace data from your application. Amazon ECS uses an AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar container to collect and route trace data to AWS X-Ray. For more information, see Setting up AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in Amazon ECS.
For the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector to send trace data to AWS X-Ray, your application must be configured to create the trace data. For more information, see Instrumenting your application for AWS X-Ray in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.
Required IAM permissions for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration with AWS X-Ray
The Amazon ECS integration with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry requires that you create a task IAM role and specify the role in your task definition. We recommend that the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar also be configured to route container logs to CloudWatch Logs which requires a task execution IAM role be created and specified in your task definition as well. The new Amazon ECS console experience takes care of the task execution IAM role on your behalf, but the task IAM role must be created manually. For more information about creating a task execution IAM role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Important If you're also collecting application metrics using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration, ensure your task IAM role also contains the permissions necessary for that integration. For more information, see Collecting application metrics (p. 312).
To create a task IAM role for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration

Exporting application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch
The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) metrics collection feature is in preview. The preview is open to all AWS accounts. Features may be added or changed before announcing General Availability.
Amazon ECS on Fargate supports exporting your custom application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch as custom metrics. This is done by adding the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar container to your task definition. The new Amazon ECS console experience simplifies this process by adding the Use metric collection option when creating a new task definition. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66).
The application metrics are exported to CloudWatch Logs with log group name /aws/ecs/ application/metrics and the metrics can be viewed in the ECS/AWSOTel/Application namespace. Your application must be instrumented with the OpenTelemetry SDK. For more information, see Introduction to AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Exporting application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch
Considerations
The following should be considered when using the Amazon ECS on Fargate integration with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to send application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
· When this integration is used, Amazon ECS doesn't send any task-level metrics to CloudWatch Container Insights. You can enable Container Insights at the Amazon ECS cluster level to receive those metrics. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
· The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration is only supported for Amazon ECS workloads hosted on Fargate. Amazon ECS workloads hosted on Amazon EC2 instances or external instances aren't currently supported.
· CloudWatch supports a maximum of 10 dimensions per metric. By default, Amazon ECS defaults to including the TaskARN, ClusterARN, LaunchType, TaskDefinitionFamily, and TaskDefinitionRevision dimensions to the metrics. The remaining 5 dimensions can be defined by your application. If more than 10 dimensions are configured, CloudWatch can't display them. When this occurs, the application metrics will appear in the ECS/AWSOTel/Application CloudWatch metric namespace but without any dimensions. You can instrument your application to add additional dimensions. For more information, see Using CloudWatch metrics with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation.
Required IAM permissions for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration with Amazon CloudWatch
The Amazon ECS integration with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry requires that you create a task IAM role and specify the role in your task definition. We recommend that the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar also be configured to route container logs to CloudWatch Logs which requires a task execution IAM role be created and specified in your task definition as well. The new Amazon ECS console experience takes care of the task execution IAM role on your behalf, but the task IAM role must be created manually and added to your task definition. For more information about the task execution IAM role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Important If you're also collecting application trace data using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration, ensure your task IAM role also contains the permissions necessary for that integration. For more information, see Collecting application trace data (p. 310).
To create a task IAM role for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration with CloudWatch
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Policies, Create policy. 3. On the Create policy page, switch to the JSON tab, copy and paste the following IAM policy JSON
into the field, then choose Next: Tags.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "logs:PutLogEvents", "logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:DescribeLogStreams", "logs:DescribeLogGroups", "cloudwatch:PutMetricData" ], "Resource": "*"

} ] }
Note If your application requires any additional permissions, you should add them to this policy. Each task definition may only specify one task IAM role.

Exporting application metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus
The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) metrics collection feature is in preview. The preview is open to all AWS accounts. Features may be added or changed before announcing General Availability.
Amazon ECS supports exporting your task-level CPU, memory, network, and storage metrics and your custom application metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. This is done by adding the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar container to your task definition. The new Amazon ECS console experience simplifies this process by adding the Use metric collection option when creating a new task definition. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66).
The metrics are exported to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and can be viewed using the Amazon Managed Grafana dashboard. Your application must be instrumented with either Prometheus libraries or with the OpenTelemetry SDK. For more information about instrumenting your application with the OpenTelemetry SDK, see Introduction to AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation.
When using the Prometheus libraries, your application must expose a /metrics endpoint which is used to scrape the metrics data. For more information about instrumenting your application with Prometheus libraries, see Prometheus client libraries in the Prometheus documentation.
Considerations
The following should be considered when using the Amazon ECS on Fargate integration with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to send application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
· The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration is only supported for Amazon ECS workloads hosted on Fargate. Amazon ECS workloads hosted on Amazon EC2 instances or external instances aren't supported currently.
· Amazon ECS doesn't send any task-level metrics to CloudWatch Container Insights. You can enable Container Insights at the Amazon ECS cluster level to receive those metrics. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
· By default, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry includes all available task-level dimensions for your application metrics when exporting to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. You can also
315

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Exporting application metrics to Amazon

instrument your application to add additional dimensions. For more information, see Getting Started with Prometheus Remote Write Exporter for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation.
Required IAM permissions for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus
The Amazon ECS integration with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar requires that you create a task IAM role and specify the role in your task definition. This task IAM role must be created manually using the steps below prior to registering your task definition.
We recommend that the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry sidecar also be configured to route container logs to CloudWatch Logs which requires a task execution IAM role be created and specified in your task definition as well. The new Amazon ECS console experience takes care of the task execution IAM role on your behalf, but the task IAM role must be created manually. For more information about creating a task execution IAM role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Important If you're also collecting application trace data using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration, ensure your task IAM role also contains the permissions necessary for that integration. For more information, see Collecting application trace data (p. 310).
To create a task IAM role for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role. 3. In the Select type of trusted entity section, choose AWS service, Elastic Container Service. 4. For Select your use case, choose Elastic Container Service Task, then choose Next: Permissions. 5.

Logging Amazon ECS API calls with AWS CloudTrail
Amazon ECS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon ECS. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon ECS as events, including calls from the Amazon ECS console and from code calls to the Amazon ECS API operations.
If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon ECS. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon ECS, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.
For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
Amazon ECS information in CloudTrail
CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in Amazon ECS, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history.
317

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Understanding Amazon ECS log file entries
You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.
For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Amazon ECS, create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see:
· Overview for Creating a Trail · CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations · Configuring Amazon SNS Notifications for CloudTrail · Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Regions and Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple
Accounts
All Amazon ECS actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference. For example, calls to the CreateService, RunTask and DeleteCluster sections generate entries in the CloudTrail log files.
Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The identity information helps you determine the following:
· Whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials. · Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user. · Whether the request was made by another AWS service.
For more information, see the CloudTrail userIdentity Element.
Understanding Amazon ECS log file entries
A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files are not an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they do not appear in any specific order.
Note These examples have been formatted for improved readability. In a CloudTrail log file, all entries and events are concatenated into a single line. In addition, this example has been limited to a single Amazon ECS entry. In a real CloudTrail log file, you see entries and events from multiple AWS services.
The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates the CreateCluster action:
{ "eventVersion": "1.04", "userIdentity": { "type": "AssumedRole", "principalId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE:account_name", "arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:user/Mary_Major", "accountId": "123456789012", "accessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE", "sessionContext": { "attributes": { "mfaAuthenticated": "false", "creationDate": "2018-06-20T18:32:25Z"

Security in Amazon Elastic Container Service
Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.
Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:
· Security of the cloud ­ AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the AWS compliance programs. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Amazon Elastic Container Service, see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program.
· Security in the cloud ­ Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company's requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.
This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when using Amazon ECS. The following topics show you how to configure Amazon ECS to meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other AWS services that help you to monitor and secure your Amazon ECS resources.
Topics · Identity and Access Management for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 320) · Logging and Monitoring in Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 375) · Compliance Validation for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 376) · Infrastructure Security in Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 376)
Identity and Access Management for Amazon Elastic Container Service
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use Amazon ECS resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge.

Audience
How you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) differs, depending on the work that you do in Amazon ECS.
Service user ­ If you use the Amazon ECS service to do your job, then your administrator provides you with the credentials and permissions that you need. As you use more Amazon ECS features to do your work, you might need additional permissions. Understanding how access is managed can help you request the right permissions from your administrator. If you cannot access a feature in Amazon ECS, see Troubleshooting Amazon Elastic Container Service identity and access (p. 373).
Service administrator ­ If you're in charge of Amazon ECS resources at your company, you probably have full access to Amazon ECS. It's your job to determine which Amazon ECS features and resources your employees should access. You must then submit requests to your IAM administrator to change the permissions of your service users. Review the information on this page to understand the basic concepts of IAM. To learn more about how your company can use IAM with Amazon ECS, see How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM (p. 325).
IAM administrator ­ If you're an IAM administrator, you might want to learn details about how you can write policies to manage access to Amazon ECS. To view example Amazon ECS identity-based policies that you can use in IAM, see Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 331).
Authenticating with identities
Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. For more information about signing in using the AWS Management Console, see Signing in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user or root user in the IAM User Guide.
You must be authenticated (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role. You can also use your company's single sign-on authentication or even sign in using Google or Facebook. In these cases, your administrator previously set up identity federation using IAM roles. When you access AWS using credentials from another company, you are assuming a role indirectly.
To sign in directly to the AWS Management Console, use your password with your root user email address or your IAM user name. You can access AWS programmatically using your root user or IAM users access keys. AWS provides SDK and command line tools to cryptographically sign your request using your credentials. If you don't use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. Do this using Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the AWS General Reference.
Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might also be required to provide additional security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.
321

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Authenticating with identities
AWS account root user
When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.
IAM users and groups
An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. An IAM user can have long-term credentials such as a user name and password or a set of access keys. To learn how to generate access keys, see Managing access keys for IAM users in the IAM User Guide. When you generate access keys for an IAM user, make sure you view and securely save the key pair. You cannot recover the secret access key in the future. Instead, you must generate a new access key pair.
An IAM group is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users. You can't sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named IAMAdmins and give that group permissions to administer IAM resources.
Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Users have permanent long-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see When to create an IAM user (instead of a role) in the IAM User Guide.
IAM roles
An IAM role is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in the AWS Management Console by switching roles. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see Using IAM roles in the IAM User Guide.
IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:
· Temporary IAM user permissions ­ An IAM user can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task.
· Federated user access ­ Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide.
· Cross-account access ­ You can use an IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a different account to access resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see How IAM roles differ from resource-based policies in the IAM User Guide.
· Cross-service access ­ Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role.
322

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Managing access using policies
· Principal permissions ­ When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Elastic Container Service in the Service Authorization Reference.
· Service role ­ A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide.
· Service-linked role ­ A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.
· Applications running on Amazon EC2 ­ You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.
To learn whether to use IAM roles or IAM users, see When to create an IAM role (instead of a user) in the IAM User Guide.
Managing access using policies
You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. You can sign in as the root user or an IAM user, or you can assume an IAM role. When you then make a request, AWS evaluates the related identity-based or resource-based policies. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about the structure and contents of JSON policy documents, see Overview of JSON policies in the IAM User Guide.
Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.
Every IAM entity (user or role) starts with no permissions. In other words, by default, users can do nothing, not even change their own password. To give a user permission to do something, an administrator must attach a permissions policy to a user. Or the administrator can add the user to a group that has the intended permissions. When an administrator gives permissions to a group, all users in that group are granted those permissions.
IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, suppose that you have a policy that allows the iam:GetRole action. A user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.
Identity-based policies
Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based policy, see Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide.
Identity-based policies can be further categorized as inline policies or managed policies. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. Managed policies are standalone policies that
323

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Managing access using policies
you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. Managed policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. To learn how to choose between a managed policy or an inline policy, see Choosing between managed policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide.
Resource-based policies
Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resourcebased policies are IAM role trust policies and Amazon S3 bucket policies. In services that support resourcebased policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must specify a principal in a resource-based policy. Principals can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.
Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located in that service. You can't use AWS managed policies from IAM in a resource-based policy.
Access control lists (ACLs)
Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.
Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs. To learn more about ACLs, see Access control list (ACL) overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Other policy types
AWS supports additional, less-common policy types. These policy types can set the maximum permissions granted to you by the more common policy types.
· Permissions boundaries ­ A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity (IAM user or role). You can set a permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the intersection of entity's identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. Resource-based policies that specify the user or role in the Principal field are not limited by the permissions boundary. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM User Guide.
· Service control policies (SCPs) ­ SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU) in AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations is a service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts that your business owns. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and SCPs, see How SCPs work in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
· Session policies ­ Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity-based policies and the session policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information, see Session policies in the IAM User Guide.
Multiple policy types
When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more complicated to understand. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request when multiple policy types are involved, see Policy evaluation logic in the IAM User Guide.

Yes

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based policy, see Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide.
With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. You can't specify the principal in an identity-based policy because it applies to the user or role to which it is attached. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON policy elements reference in the IAM User Guide.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM

Resource-based policies within Amazon ECS

Supports resource-based policies

No

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resourcebased policies are IAM role trust policies and Amazon S3 bucket policies. In services that support resourcebased policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must specify a principal in a resource-based policy. Principals can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.
To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities in another account as the principal in a resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-based policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and the resource are in different AWS accounts, an IAM administrator in the trusted account must also grant the principal entity (user or role) permission to access the resource. They grant permission by attaching an identity-based policy to the entity. However, if a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information, see How IAM roles differ from resource-based policies in the IAM User Guide.
Policy actions for Amazon ECS

Supports policy actions

Yes

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.
The Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.
Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.
To see a list of Amazon ECS actions, see Actions defined by Amazon Elastic Container Service in the Service Authorization Reference.
Policy actions in Amazon ECS use the following prefix before the action:
ecs
To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas.
"Action": [ "ecs:action1", "ecs:action2" ]

You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:
326

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM

"Action": "ecs:Describe*"
To view examples of Amazon ECS identity-based policies, see Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 331).
Policy resources for Amazon ECS

Supports policy resources

Partial

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.
The Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.
For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.
"Resource": "*"
To see a list of Amazon ECS resource types and their ARNs, see Resources defined by Amazon Elastic Container Service in the Service Authorization Reference. To learn with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource, see Actions defined by Amazon Elastic Container Service.

Some Amazon ECS API actions support multiple resources. For example, multiple clusters can be referenced when calling the DescribeClusters API action. To specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.
"Resource": [ "EXAMPLE-RESOURCE-1", "EXAMPLE-RESOURCE-2"
For example, the Amazon ECS cluster resource has the following ARN:
arn:${Partition}:ecs:${Region}:${Account}:cluster/${clusterName}
To specify my-cluster-1 and my-cluster-2 cluster in your statement, use the following ARNs:
"Resource": [ "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-cluster-1", "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-cluster-2"
To specify all clusters that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):
"Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/*"
For task definitions, you can specify the latest revision, or a specific revision. To specify the latest task definition, use:

327

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM

"Resource:arn:${Partition}:ecs:${Region}:${Account}:task-definition/ ${TaskDefinitionFamilyName}"
To specify a specific task definition revision, use ${TaskDefinitionRevisionNumber}:
"Resource:arn:${Partition}:ecs:${Region}:${Account}:task-definition/ ${TaskDefinitionFamilyName}:${TaskDefinitionRevisionNumber}"
To view examples of Amazon ECS identity-based policies, see Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 331).
Policy condition keys for Amazon ECS

Supports service-specific policy condition keys

Yes

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.
The Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.
If you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.
You can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.
AWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.
Amazon ECS supports the following service-specific condition keys that you can use to provide finegrained filtering for your IAM policies:

Condition Key

Description

Evaluation Types

aws:RequestTag/ ${TagKey}

The context key is formatted "aws:RequestTag/tagkey":"tag-value" where tag-keyand tag-value are a tag key and value pair.

String

aws:ResourceTag/ ${TagKey}

Checks that the tag key­value pair is present in an AWS request. For example, you could check to see that the request includes the tag key "Dept" and that it has the value "Accounting".
The context key is formatted "aws:ResourceTag/tagkey":"tag-value" where tag-keyand tag-value are a tag key and value pair.

String

Checks that the tag attached to the identity resource (user or role) matches the specified key name and value.

ecs:ResourceTag/ ${TagKey}

The context key is formatted "ecs:ResourceTag/tagkey":"tag-value" where tag-keyand tag-value are a tag key and value pair.

String

Checks that the tag attached to the identity resource (user or role) matches the specified key name and value.

ecs:cluster

The context key is formatted "ecs:cluster":"clusterarn" where cluster-arn is the ARN for the Amazon ECS cluster.

ARN, Null

ecs:containerinstances

The context key is formatted "ecs:containerinstances":"container-instance-arns" where container-instance-arns is one or more container instance ARNs.

ARN, Null

ecs:containername

The context key is formatted "ecs:containername":"container-name" where containerinstance- is the name of an Amazon ECS container which is defined in the ECS task definition.

String

ecs:enable-

The context key is formatted "ecs:enable-execute-

execute-command command":"value" where value- is "true" or "false".

String

ecs:task-definition

The context key is formatted "ecs:taskdefinition":"task-definition-arn" where taskdefinition-arn is the ARN for the Amazon ECS task definition.

ARN, Null

ecs:service

The context key is formatted "ecs:service":"servicearn" where service-arn is the ARN for the Amazon ECS service.

ARN, Null

Access control lists (ACLs) in Amazon ECS

Supports ACLs

No

Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.

329

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) with Amazon ECS

Supports ABAC (tags in policies)

Yes

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called tags. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users or roles) and to many AWS resources. Tagging entities and resources is the first step of ABAC. Then you design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource that they are trying to access.
ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations where policy management becomes cumbersome.
To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the aws:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.
For more information about ABAC, see What is ABAC? in the IAM User Guide. To view a tutorial with steps for setting up ABAC, see Use attribute-based access control (ABAC) in the IAM User Guide.
For more information about tagging Amazon ECS resources, see Resources and tags (p. 276).
To view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on the tags on that resource, see Describing Amazon ECS Services Based on Tags (p. 339).
Using Temporary credentials with Amazon ECS

Supports temporary credentials

Yes

Some AWS services don't work when you sign in using temporary credentials. For additional information, including which AWS services work with temporary credentials, see AWS services that work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.
You are using temporary credentials if you sign in to the AWS Management Console using any method except a user name and password. For example, when you access AWS using your company's single sign-on (SSO) link, that process automatically creates temporary credentials. You also automatically create temporary credentials when you sign in to the console as a user and then switch roles. For more information about switching roles, see Switching to a role (console) in the IAM User Guide.
You can manually create temporary credentials using the AWS CLI or AWS API. You can then use those temporary credentials to access AWS. AWS recommends that you dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys. For more information, see Temporary security credentials in IAM.
Cross-service principal permissions for Amazon ECS

Supports principal permissions

Yes

When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that

330

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Identity-based policy examples
then triggers another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Elastic Container Service in the Service Authorization Reference.
Service roles for Amazon ECS

Supports service roles

Yes

A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide.
Warning Changing the permissions for a service role might break Amazon ECS functionality. Edit service roles only when Amazon ECS provides guidance to do so.
Service-linked roles for Amazon ECS

Supports service-linked roles

Yes

A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.
For details about creating or managing Amazon ECS service-linked roles, see Service-linked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348).
Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service
By default, IAM users and roles don't have permission to create or modify Amazon ECS resources. They also can't perform tasks using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform actions on the resources that they need. The administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.
To learn how to create an IAM identity-based policy using these example JSON policy documents, see Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Identity-based policy examples
Policy best practices
Identity-based policies are very powerful. They determine whether someone can create, access, or delete Amazon ECS resources in your account. These actions can incur costs for your AWS account. When you create or edit identity-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:
· Get started using AWS managed policies ­ To start using Amazon ECS quickly, use AWS managed policies to give your employees the permissions they need. These policies are already available in your account and are maintained and updated by AWS. For more information, see Get started using permissions with AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.
· Grant least privilege ­ When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later. For more information, see Grant least privilege in the IAM User Guide.
· Enable MFA for sensitive operations ­ For extra security, require IAM users to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access sensitive resources or API operations. For more information, see Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.
· Use policy conditions for extra security ­ To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity-based policies allow access to a resource. For example, you can write conditions to specify a range of allowable IP addresses that a request must come from. You can also write conditions to allow requests only within a specified date or time range, or to require the use of SSL or MFA. For more information, see IAM JSON policy elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide.
Allow users to view their own permissions
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "ViewOwnUserInfo", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "iam:GetUserPolicy", "iam:ListGroupsForUser", "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies", "iam:ListUserPolicies", "iam:GetUser" ], "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"] }, { "Sid": "NavigateInConsole", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "iam:GetGroupPolicy", "iam:GetPolicyVersion", "iam:GetPolicy", "iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies", "iam:ListGroupPolicies", "iam:ListPolicyVersions", "iam:ListPolicies", "iam:ListUsers" ], "Resource": "*"

Amazon ECS first-run wizard permissions
The Amazon ECS first-run wizard in the classic console simplifies the process of creating a cluster and running your tasks and services. However, users require permissions to many API operations from multiple AWS services to complete the wizard. The AmazonECS_FullAccess (p. 341) managed policy below shows the required permissions to complete the Amazon ECS first-run wizard.

The first run wizard also attempts to automatically create different IAM roles depending on the launch type of the tasks used. Examples are the Amazon ECS service role, container instance IAM role, and the task execution IAM role. To ensure that the first-run experience is able to create these IAM roles, one of the following must be true:
· Your user has administrator access. For more information, see Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4).
· Your user has the IAM permissions to create a service role. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service.
· You have a user with administrator access manually create the required IAM role so it is available on the account to be used. For more information, see the following:
· Service-linked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348)
· Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354)
Cluster examples
The following IAM policy allows permission to create and list clusters. The CreateCluster and ListClusters actions do not accept any resources, so the resource definition is set to * for all resources.

Update Service Example
The following IAM policy allows a user to update Amazon ECS services in the AWS Management Console:

}
Describing Amazon ECS Services Based on Tags
You can use conditions in your identity-based policy to control access to Amazon ECS resources based on tags. This example shows how you might create a policy that allows describing your services. However,
339

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS managed policies for Amazon ECS
permission is granted only if the service tag Owner has the value of that user's user name. This policy also grants the permissions necessary to complete this action on the console.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "DescribeServices", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "ecs:DescribeServices", "Resource": "*" }, { "Sid": "ViewServiceIfOwner", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "ecs:DescribeServices", "Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:*:service/*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": {"ecs:ResourceTag/Owner": "${aws:username}"} } } ]
}
You can attach this policy to the IAM users in your account. If a user named richard-roe attempts to describe an Amazon ECS service, the service must be tagged Owner=richard-roe or owner=richardroe. Otherwise he is denied access. The condition tag key Owner matches both Owner and owner because condition key names are not case-sensitive. For more information, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide.
AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Service
To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed policies than to write policies yourself. It takes time and expertise to create IAM customer managed policies that provide your team with only the permissions they need. To get started quickly, you can use our AWS managed policies. These policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account. For more information about AWS managed policies, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.
AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies. You can't change the permissions in AWS managed policies. Services occasionally add additional permissions to an AWS managed policy to support new features. This type of update affects all identities (users, groups, and roles) where the policy is attached. Services are most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new operations become available. Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed policy, so policy updates won't break your existing permissions.
Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services. For example, the ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and resources. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see AWS managed policies for job functions in the IAM User Guide.
Amazon ECS and Amazon ECR provide several managed policies and trust relationships that you can attach to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS tasks that allow differing levels of control over resources and API operations. You can apply these policies directly, or you can use them as starting points for creating your own policies. For more information about the Amazon ECR managed policies, see Amazon ECR managed policies.
340

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS managed policies for Amazon ECS
AmazonECS_FullAccess
You can attach the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy to your IAM identities.
This policy grants administrative access to Amazon ECS resources and grants an IAM identity (such as a user, group, or role) access to the AWS services that Amazon ECS is integrated with to use all of Amazon ECS features. Using this policy allows access to all of Amazon ECS features that are available in the AWS Management Console.
Permissions details
The AmazonECS_FullAccess managed IAM policy includes the following permissions. Following the best practice of granting least privilege, you can use the AmazonECS_FullAccess managed policy as a template for creating you own custom policy. That way, you can take away or add permissions to and from the managed policy based on your specific requirements.
· ecs ­ Allows principals full access to all Amazon ECS APIs. · application-autoscaling ­ Allows principals to create, describe, and manage Application Auto
Scaling resources. This is required when enabling service auto scaling for your Amazon ECS services. · appmesh ­ Allows principals to list App Mesh service meshes and virtual nodes and describe App Mesh
virtual nodes. This is required when integrating your Amazon ECS services with App Mesh. · autoscaling ­ Allows principals to create, manage, and describe Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources.
This is required when managing Amazon EC2 auto scaling groups when using the cluster auto scaling feature. · cloudformation ­ Allows principals to create and manage AWS CloudFormation stacks. This is required when creating Amazon ECS clusters using the AWS Management Console and the subsequent managing of those clusters. · cloudwatch ­ Allows principals to create, manage, and describe Amazon CloudWatch alarms. · codedeploy ­ Allows principals to create and manage application deployments as well as view their configurations, revisions, and deployment targets. · sns ­ Allows principals to view a list of Amazon SNS topics. · lambda ­ Allows principals to view a list of AWS Lambda functions and their version specific configurations. · ec2 ­ Allows principals run Amazon EC2 instances as well as create and manage routes, route tables, internet gateways, launch groups, security groups, virtual private clouds, spot fleets, and subnets. · elasticloadbalancing ­ Allows principals to create, describe, and delete Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Principals will also be able to fully manage the target groups, listeners, and listener rules for load balancers. · events ­ Allows principals to create, manage, and delete Amazon EventBridge rules and their targets. · iam­ Allows principals to list IAM roles and their attached policies.

AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
The AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy managed IAM policy grants the permissions that are needed by the Amazon ECS container agent and AWS Fargate container agents to make AWS API calls on your behalf. This policy can be added to your task execution IAM role. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
Permissions details
The AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy managed IAM policy includes the following permissions. Following the standard security advice of granting least privilege, the AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy managed policy can be used as a guide. If any of the permissions that are granted in the managed policy aren't needed for your use case, create a custom policy and add only the permissions that you require.
· ecr:GetAuthorizationToken ­ Allows a principal to retrieve an authorization token. The authorization token represents your IAM authentication credentials and can be used to access any Amazon ECR registry that the IAM principal has access to. The authorization token received is valid for 12 hours.
· ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability ­ When a container image is pushed to an Amazon ECR private repository, each image layer is checked to verify if it's already pushed. If it's pushed, then the image layer is skipped.
· ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer ­ When a container image is pulled from an Amazon ECR private repository, this API is called once for each image layer that's not already cached.
· ecr:BatchGetImage ­ When a container image is pulled from an Amazon ECR private repository, this API is called once to retrieve the image manifest.
· logs:CreateLogStream ­ Allows a principal to create a CloudWatch Logs log stream for a specified log group.
· logs:PutLogEvents ­ Allows a principal to upload a batch of log events to a specified log stream.

Description
Amazon ECS started tracking changes for its AWS managed policies.

Date June 8, 2021

Phased out AWS managed IAM policies for Amazon Elastic Container Service
The following AWS managed IAM policies are phased out. These policies are now replaced by the updated policies. We recommend that you update your IAM users or roles to use the updated policies.
AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess
Important The AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess managed IAM policy was phased out as of January 29, 2021, in response to a security finding with the iam:passRole permission. This permission grants access to all resources including credentials to roles in the account. Now that the policy is phased out, you can't attach the policy to any new IAM users or roles. Any users or roles that already have the policy attached can continue using it. However, we recommend that you update your IAM users or roles to use the AmazonECS_FullAccess managed policy instead. For more information, see Migrating to the AmazonECS_FullAccess managed policy (p. 347).
AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole
Important The AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole managed IAM policy is phased out. It's now replaced by the Amazon ECS service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role for Amazon ECS (p. 348).

346

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate AWS managed policies for Amazon ECS
AmazonEC2ContainerServiceAutoscaleRole
Important The AmazonEC2ContainerServiceAutoscaleRole managed IAM policy is phased out. It's now replaced by the Application Auto Scaling service-linked role for Amazon ECS. For more information, see Service-linked roles for Application Auto Scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.
Migrating to the AmazonECS_FullAccess managed policy
The AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess managed IAM policy was phased out on January 29, 2021, in response to a security finding with the iam:passRole permission. This permission grants access to all resources including credentials to roles in the account. Now that the policy is phased out, you can't attach the policy to any new IAM groups, users, or roles. Any groups, users, or roles that already have the policy attached can continue using it. However, we recommend that you update your IAM groups, users, or roles to use the AmazonECS_FullAccess managed policy instead.
The permissions that are granted by the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy include the complete list of permissions that are necessary to use ECS as an administrator. If you currently use permissions that are granted by the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess policy that aren't in the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy, you can add them to an in-line policy statement. For more information, see AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Service (p. 340).
Use the following steps to determine if you have any IAM groups, users, or roles that are currently using the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess managed IAM policy. Then, update them to detach the earlier policy and attach the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy.
To update an IAM group, user, or role to use the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy (AWS Management Console)
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Policies and search for and select the
AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess policy. 3. Choose the Policy usage tab that displays any IAM role that's currently using this policy. 4. For each IAM role that's currently using the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess
policy, select the role and use the following steps to detach the deprecated policy and attach the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy.
a. On the Permissions tab, choose the X next to the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess policy.
b. Choose Add permissions. c. Choose Attach existing policies directly, search for and select the AmazonECS_FullAccess
policy, and then choose Next: Review. d. Review the changes and then choose Add permissions. e. Repeat these steps for each IAM group, user, or role that's using the
AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess policy.
To update an IAM group, user, or role to use the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy (AWS CLI)
1. Use the generate-service-last-accessed-details command to generate a report that includes details about when the deprecated policy was last used.
aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \ --arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess
Example output:
347

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service-linked role
{ "JobId": "32bb1fb0-1ee0-b08e-3626-ae83EXAMPLE"
}
2. Use the job ID from the previous output with the get-service-last-accessed-details command to retrieve the last accessed report of the service. This report displays the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM entities that last used the deprecated policy.
aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details \ --job-id 32bb1fb0-1ee0-b08e-3626-ae83EXAMPLE
3. Use one of the following commands to detach the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess policy from an IAM group, user, or role.
· detach-group-policy · detach-role-policy · detach-user-policy 4. Use one of the following commands to attach the AmazonECS_FullAccess policy to an IAM group, user, or role.
· attach-group-policy · attach-role-policy · attach-user-policy
Service-linked role for Amazon ECS
Amazon ECS uses a service-linked role for the permissions the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see Using service-linked roles in the IAM User Guide.
Permissions granted by the service-linked role
Amazon ECS uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForECS to enable Amazon ECS to call AWS APIs on your behalf.
The AWSServiceRoleForECS service-linked role trusts the ecs.amazonaws.com service principal to assume the role.
The role permissions policy allows Amazon ECS to complete the following actions on resources.

Create the service-linked role
Under most circumstances, you don't need to manually create the service-linked role. For example, when you create a new cluster (for example, with the Amazon ECS first-run experience, the cluster creation wizard, or the AWS CLI or SDKs), or create or update a service in the AWS Management Console, Amazon ECS creates the service-linked role for you, if it does not already exist.
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role.
To allow an IAM entity to create the AWSServiceRoleForECS service-linked role
Add the following statement to the permissions policy for the IAM entity that needs to create the service-linked role:
{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole" ],
350

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service-linked role
"Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/ecs.amazonaws.com/ AWSServiceRoleForECS*",
"Condition": {"StringLike": {"iam:AWSServiceName": "ecs.amazonaws.com"}} }
Creating a service-linked role in IAM (AWS CLI)
You can use IAM commands from the AWS Command Line Interface to create a service-linked role with the trust policy and inline policies that the service needs to assume the role.
To create a service-linked role (CLI)
Use the following command:
$ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ecs.amazonaws.com
Edit the service-linked role
After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. You can't edit the AWS owned IAM policy that the Amazon ECS service-linked role uses either as it contains all the necessary permissions Amazon ECS needs. However, you can edit the description of the role.
To allow an IAM entity to edit the description of the AWSServiceRoleForECS service-linked role
Add the following statement to the permissions policy for the IAM entity that needs to edit the description of a service-linked role:
{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "iam:UpdateRoleDescription" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/ecs.amazonaws.com/
AWSServiceRoleForECS*", "Condition": {"StringLike": {"iam:AWSServiceName": "ecs.amazonaws.com"}}
}
Delete the service-linked role
If you no longer use Amazon ECS, we recommend that you delete the service-linked role. That way you don't have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must delete all Amazon ECS clusters in all regions before you can delete the service-linked role.
To allow an IAM entity to delete the AWSServiceRoleForECS service-linked role
Add the following statement to the permissions policy for the IAM entity that needs to delete a servicelinked role:
{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole", "iam:GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/ecs.amazonaws.com/
AWSServiceRoleForECS*", "Condition": {"StringLike": {"iam:AWSServiceName": "ecs.amazonaws.com"}}
}

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service-linked role
Cleaning up a service-linked role
Before you can use IAM to delete a service-linked role, you must first confirm that the role has no active sessions and delete all Amazon ECS clusters in all AWS Regions.
To check whether the service-linked role has an active session
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles and choose the AWSServiceRoleForECS name (not the check
box). 3. On the Summary page, choose Access Advisor and review recent activity for the service-linked role.
Note If you are unsure whether Amazon ECS is using the AWSServiceRoleForECS role, you can try to delete the role. If the service is using the role, then the deletion fails and you can view the regions where the role is being used. If the role is being used, then you must wait for the session to end before you can delete the role. You cannot revoke the session for a service-linked role.
To remove Amazon ECS resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForECS service-linked role
You must delete all Amazon ECS clusters in all AWS Regions before you can delete the AWSServiceRoleForECS role.
· Delete all Amazon ECS clusters in all regions. For more information, see Deleting a cluster using the classic console (p. 83).
Deleting a Service-Linked Role in IAM (Console)
You can use the IAM console to delete a service-linked role.
To delete a service-linked role (console)
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https:// console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles. Then select the check box next to AWSServiceRoleForECS, not the name or row itself.
3. Choose Delete role. 4. In the confirmation dialog box, review the service last accessed data, which shows when each of the
selected roles last accessed an AWS service. This helps you to confirm whether the role is currently active. If you want to proceed, choose Yes, Delete to submit the service-linked role for deletion. 5. Watch the IAM console notifications to monitor the progress of the service-linked role deletion. Because the IAM service-linked role deletion is asynchronous, after you submit the role for deletion, the deletion task can succeed or fail.
· If the task succeeds, then the role is removed from the list and a notification of success appears at the top of the page.
· If the task fails, you can choose View details or View Resources from the notifications to learn why the deletion failed. If the deletion fails because the role is using the service's resources, then the notification includes a list of resources, if the service returns that information. You can then clean up the resources and submit the deletion again. Note You might have to repeat this process several times, depending on the information that the service returns. For example, your service-linked role might use six resources and your
352

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service-linked role
service might return information about five of them. If you clean up the five resources and submit the role for deletion again, the deletion fails and the service reports the one remaining resource. A service might return all of the resources, a few of them, or it might not report any resources. · If the task fails and the notification does not include a list of resources, then the service might not return that information. To learn how to clean up the resources for that service, see AWS services that work with IAM. Find your service in the table, and choose the Yes link to view the servicelinked role documentation for that service.
Deleting a Service-Linked Role in IAM (AWS CLI)
You can use IAM commands from the AWS Command Line Interface to delete a service-linked role.
To delete a service-linked role (CLI)
1. Because a service-linked role cannot be deleted if it is being used or has associated resources, you must submit a deletion request. That request can be denied if these conditions are not met. You must capture the deletion-task-id from the response to check the status of the deletion task. Enter the following command to submit a service-linked role deletion request:
$ aws iam delete-service-linked-role --role-name AWSServiceRoleForECS+OPTIONAL-SUFFIX
2. Use the following command to check the status of the deletion task:
$ aws iam get-service-linked-role-deletion-status --deletion-task-id deletion-task-id
The status of the deletion task can be NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED. If the deletion fails, the call returns the reason that it failed so that you can troubleshoot. If the deletion fails because the role is using the service's resources, then the notification includes a list of resources, if the service returns that information. You can then clean up the resources and submit the deletion again.
Note You might have to repeat this process several times, depending on the information that the service returns. For example, your service-linked role might use six resources and your service might return information about five of them. If you clean up the five resources and submit the role for deletion again, the deletion fails and the service reports the one remaining resource. A service might return all of the resources, a few of them, or it might not report any resources. To learn how to clean up the resources for a service that does not report any resources, see AWS services that work with IAM. Find your service in the table, and choose the Yes link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Deleting a Service-Linked Role in IAM (AWSAPI)
You can use the IAM API to delete a service-linked role.
To delete a service-linked role (API)
1. To submit a deletion request for a service-linked roll, call DeleteServiceLinkedRole. In the request, specify the AWSServiceRoleForECS role name.
Because a service-linked role cannot be deleted if it is being used or has associated resources, you must submit a deletion request. That request can be denied if these conditions are not met. You must capture the DeletionTaskId from the response to check the status of the deletion task. 2. To check the status of the deletion, call GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus. In the request, specify the DeletionTaskId.
353

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task execution IAM role
The status of the deletion task can be NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED. If the deletion fails, the call returns the reason that it failed so that you can troubleshoot. If the deletion fails because the role is using the service's resources, then the notification includes a list of resources, if the service returns that information. You can then clean up the resources and submit the deletion again.
Note You might have to repeat this process several times, depending on the information that the service returns. For example, your service-linked role might use six resources and your service might return information about five of them. If you clean up the five resources and submit the role for deletion again, the deletion fails and the service reports the one remaining resource.

Amazon ECS task execution IAM role
The task execution role grants the Amazon ECS container and Fargate agents permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The task execution IAM role is required depending on the requirements of your task. You can have multiple task execution roles for different purposes and services associated with your account.
The following are common use cases for a task execution IAM role:
· Your task is hosted on AWS Fargate or on an external instance and... · is pulling a container image from an Amazon ECR private repository. · sends container logs to CloudWatch Logs using the awslogs log driver. For more information, see Using the awslogs log driver (p. 138).
· Your tasks are hosted on either AWS Fargate or Amazon EC2 instances and... · is using private registry authentication. For more information, see Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication (p. 356). · the task definition is referencing sensitive data using Secrets Manager secrets or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters. For more information, see Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets (p. 357).
Note The task execution role is supported by Amazon ECS container agent version 1.16.0 and later.
Amazon ECS provides the managed policy named AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy which contains the permissions the common use cases described above require. It may be necessary to add inline policies to your task execution role for special use cases which are outlined below.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken", "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability", "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer", "ecr:BatchGetImage", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents"

], "Resource": "*" } ] }
An Amazon ECS task execution role can be created for you in the Amazon ECS console; however, you should manually attach the managed IAM policy for tasks to allow Amazon ECS to add permissions for future features and enhancements as they are introduced. You can use the following procedure to check and see if your account already has the Amazon ECS task execution role and to attach the managed IAM policy if needed.
To check for the ecsTaskExecutionRole in the IAM console
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles. 3. Search the list of roles for ecsTaskExecutionRole. If the role does not exist, see Creating the task
execution IAM role (p. 355). If the role does exist, select the role to view the attached policies. 4. On the Permissions tab, ensure that the AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy managed policy
is attached to the role. If the policy is attached, your Amazon ECS task execution role is properly configured. If not, follow the substeps below to attach the policy.
a. Choose Add Permissions, Attach policies. b. To narrow the available policies to attach, for Filter, type AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy. c. Check the box to the left of the AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy policy and choose Attach
policy. 5. Choose Trust relationships. 6. Verify that the trust relationship contains the following policy. If the trust relationship matches the
policy below, choose Cancel. If the trust relationship does not match, choose Edit trust policy, copy the policy into the Policy Document window and choose Update policy.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com" }, "Action": "sts:AssumeRole" } ]
}
Creating the task execution IAM role
If your account does not already have a task execution role, use the following steps to create the role.
To create a task execution IAM role (AWS Management Console)
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role. 3. In the Trusted entity type section, choose AWS service, Elastic Container Service. 4. For Use case, choose Elastic Container Service Task, then choose Next.

boundary. c. Choose Next. 6. Under Role details, do the following:
a. For Role name, type ecsTaskExecutionRole. b. For Add tags (optional), specify any custom tags to associate with the policy . 7. Choose Create role.
To create a task execution IAM role (AWS CLI)
1. Create a file named ecs-tasks-trust-policy.json that contains the trust policy to use for the IAM role. The file should contain the following:
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com" }, "Action": "sts:AssumeRole" } ]
}
2. Create an IAM role named ecsTaskExecutionRole using the trust policy created in the previous step.
aws iam create-role \ --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \ --assume-role-policy-document file://ecs-tasks-trust-policy.json
3. Attach the AWS managed AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy policy to the ecsTaskExecutionRole role. This policy provides
aws iam attach-role-policy \ --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \ --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/

Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication
The Amazon ECS task execution role is required to use the private registry authentication feature. This allows the container agent to pull the container image. For more information, see Private registry authentication for tasks (p. 174).
To provide access to the secrets that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
· secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
356

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task execution IAM role
· kms:Decrypt--Required only if your key uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The ARN for your custom key should be added as a resource.
An example inline policy adding the permissions is shown below.

}
Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets
To use the Amazon ECS secrets feature, you must have the Amazon ECS task execution role and reference it in your task definition. This allows the container agent to pull the necessary AWS Systems Manager or Secrets Manager resources. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data (p. 176).
To provide access to the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
· ssm:GetParameters--Required if you are referencing a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter in a task definition.
· secretsmanager:GetSecretValue--Required if you are referencing a Secrets Manager secret either directly or if your Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter is referencing a Secrets Manager secret in a task definition.
· kms:Decrypt--Required only if your secret uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The ARN for your custom key should be added as a resource.
The following example inline policy adds the required permissions:
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", "kms:Decrypt" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<aws_account_id>:secret:<secret_name>", "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<aws_account_id>:key/<key_id>" ] } ]

Optional IAM permissions for Fargate tasks pulling Amazon ECR images over interface endpoints
When launching tasks that use the Fargate launch type that pull images from Amazon ECR when Amazon ECR is configured to use an interface VPC endpoint, you can restrict the tasks access to a specific VPC or VPC endpoint. Do this by creating a task execution role for the tasks to use that use IAM condition keys.
Use the following IAM global condition keys to restrict access to a specific VPC or VPC endpoint. For more information, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys.
· aws:SourceVpc--Restricts access to a specific VPC. · aws:SourceVpce--Restricts access to a specific VPC endpoint.
The following task execution role policy provides an example for adding condition keys:
Important The ecr:GetAuthorizationToken API action cannot have the aws:sourceVpc or aws:sourceVpce condition keys applied to it because the GetAuthorizationToken API call goes through the elastic network interface owned by AWS Fargate rather than the elastic network interface of the task.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents" ], "Resource": "*" }, { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability", "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer", "ecr:BatchGetImage" ], "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-xxxxxx", "aws:sourceVpc": "vpc-xxxxx" } } } ]

IAM roles for tasks
Your Amazon ECS tasks can have an IAM role associated with them. The permissions granted in the IAM role are assumed by the containers running in the task.
If your containerized applications need to call AWS APIs, they must sign their AWS API requests with AWS credentials, and a task IAM role provides a strategy for managing credentials for your applications to use, similar to the way that an Amazon EC2 instance profile provides credentials to Amazon EC2 instances. Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or using the Amazon EC2 instance's role, you can associate an IAM role with an Amazon ECS task definition or RunTask API
360

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate IAM roles for tasks
operation. Your containers can then use the AWS SDK or AWS CLI to make API requests to authorized AWS services.
The following explain the benefits of using IAM roles with your tasks.
· Credential Isolation: A container can only retrieve credentials for the IAM role that is defined in the task definition to which it belongs; a container never has access to credentials that are intended for another container that belongs to another task.
· Authorization: Unauthorized containers cannot access IAM role credentials defined for other tasks. · Auditability: Access and event logging is available through CloudTrail to ensure retrospective auditing.
Task credentials have a context of taskArn that is attached to the session, so CloudTrail logs show which task is using which role.
Note When you specify an IAM role for a task, the AWS CLI or other SDKs in the containers for that task use the AWS credentials provided by the task role exclusively and they no longer inherit any IAM permissions from the Amazon EC2 or external instance they are running on.
You can specify a task IAM role in your task definitions, or you can use a taskRoleArn override when running a task manually with the RunTask API operation. The Amazon ECS agent receives a payload message for starting the task with additional fields that contain the role credentials. The Amazon ECS agent sets a unique task credential ID as an identification token and updates its internal credential cache so that the identification token for the task points to the role credentials that are received in the payload. The Amazon ECS agent populates the AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI environment variable in the Env object (available with the docker inspect container_id command) for all containers that belong to this task with the following relative URI: /credential_provider_version/credentials? id=task_credential_id.
From inside the container, you can query the credential endpoint with the following command:
curl 169.254.170.2$AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI
Output:
{ "AccessKeyId": "ACCESS_KEY_ID", "Expiration": "EXPIRATION_DATE", "RoleArn": "TASK_ROLE_ARN", "SecretAccessKey": "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "Token": "SECURITY_TOKEN_STRING"
}
Creating an IAM role and policy for your tasks
When creating an IAM policy for your tasks to use, the policy should include the permissions that you would like the containers in your tasks to assume. You can use an existing AWS managed policy that as an example or you can create a custom policy from scratch that meets your specific needs. For more information, see Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide.
Important When creating your task IAM role, it is recommended that you use the aws:SourceAccount or aws:SourceArn condition keys in either the trust relationship or the IAM policy associated with the role to prevent the confused deputy security issue. These condition keys can be specified in the trust relationship or in the IAM policy associated with the role. To learn more about the
361

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate IAM roles for tasks
confused deputy problem and how to protect your AWS account, see The confused deputy problem in the IAM User Guide.
Once the IAM policy is created, you can create an IAM role which includes that policy which you reference in your Amazon ECS task definition. You can create the role using the Elastic Container Service Task use case in the IAM console. Then you can attach your specific IAM policy to the role that gives the containers in your task the permissions you desire. The procedures below describe how to do this.
If you have multiple task definitions or services that require IAM permissions, you should consider creating a role for each specific task definition or service with the minimum required permissions for the tasks to operate so that you can minimize the access that you provide for each task.
For information about the service endpoint for your Region, see Service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Reference Guide.
The IAM task role must have a trust policy that specifies the ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com service. The sts:AssumeRole permission allows your tasks to assume an IAM role that's different from the one that the Amazon EC2 instance uses. This way, your task doesn't inherit the role associated with the Amazon EC2 instance. It is recommended that you use the aws:SourceAccount or aws:SourceArn condition keys to scope the permissions further to prevent the confused deputy security issue. These condition keys can be specified in the trust relationship or in the IAM policy associated with the role. To learn more about the confused deputy problem and how to protect your AWS account, see The confused deputy problem in the IAM User Guide.
The following is an example trust policy. You should replace the Region identifier and specify the AWS account number that you use when launching tasks.
{ "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement":[ { "Effect":"Allow", "Principal":{ "Service":[ "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com" ] }, "Action":"sts:AssumeRole", "Condition":{ "ArnLike":{ "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:111122223333:*" }, "StringEquals":{ "aws:SourceAccount":"111122223333" } } } ]
}
To create an IAM policy for your tasks (AWS Management Console)
In this example, we create a policy to allow read-only access to an Amazon S3 bucket. You could store database credentials or other secrets in this bucket, and the containers in your task can read the credentials from the bucket and load them into your application.
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Policies and then choose Create Policy. 3. Follow the steps under one of the following tabs, which shows you how to use the visual or JSON
editors.
362

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate IAM roles for tasks
Using the visual editor
1. For Service, choose S3.
2. For Actions, expand the Read option and select GetObject.
3. For Resources, select Add ARN and enter the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your Amazon S3 bucket.
4. (Optional) For Request conditions, select Add condition. This is recommended to prevent the confused deputy security issue. To learn more about the confused deputy problem and how to protect your AWS account, see The confused deputy problem in the IAM User Guide.
a. For Condition key, select either aws:SourceAccount or aws:SourceArn. For more information about these global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.
b. For Operator, select StringEquals if you specified the aws:SourceAccount condition key or ArnLike if you specified the aws:SourceArn condition key.
c. For Value, specify your AWS account ID if you specified the aws:SourceAccount condition key or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your Amazon ECS task if you specified the aws:SourceArn condition key. You may use wildcards, for example aws:ecs:*:accountId:* which will work for all tasks in your account.
d. Choose Add to save the condition key. Repeat these steps for each condition key you want to add to the policy.
5. Choose Next: Tags and add any resource tags to the policy to help you organize them and then choose Next: Review.
6. On the Review policy page, for Name type your own unique name, such as AmazonECSTaskS3BucketPolicy. You may specify an optional description for the policy as well.
7. When the policy is complete, choose Create policy to finish.
Using the JSON editor
1. In the policy document field, paste the policy to apply to your tasks. The example below allows permission to the my-task-secrets-bucket Amazon S3 bucket. It includes a condition statement, which you can use to specify either a specific task using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or a specific account ID. This provides a way to further scope the permission for additional security. This is recommended to prevent the confused deputy security issue. To learn more about the confused deputy problem and how to protect your AWS account, see The confused deputy problem in the IAM User Guide.
The following is an example permissions policy. You can modify the policy to suit your specific needs. You should replace the Region identifier and specify the AWS account number that you use when launching tasks.
{ "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement":[ { "Effect":"Allow", "Action":[ "s3:GetObject" ], "Resource":[ "arn:aws:s3:::my-task-secrets-bucket/*" ], "Condition":{ "ArnLike":{ "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:111122223333:*"
363

}, "StringEquals":{
"aws:SourceAccount":"111122223333" } } } ] }
2. Choose Next: Tags and add any resource tags to the policy to help you organize them and then choose Next: Review.
3. On the Review policy page, for Name type your own unique name, such as AmazonECSTaskS3BucketPolicy. You may specify an optional description for the policy as well.
4. When the policy is complete, choose Create policy to finish.
To create an IAM role for your tasks (AWS Management Console)
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role. 3. For Select trusted entity section, choose AWS service. 4. For Use case, using the drop down menu, select Elastic Container Service and then the Elastic
Container Service Task use case and then choose Next. 5. For Add permissions, search for and select the policy to use for your tasks (in this example
AmazonECSTaskS3BucketPolicy, and then choose Next. 6. On Step 3: Name, review, and create, do the following:

b. (Optional) For Description. specify a description for this IAM role. c. Review the trusted entity and permissions policy for the role. d. For Add tags (Optional), enter any metadata tags you want to associate with the IAM role, and
then choose Create role.
Using a supported AWS SDK
Support for IAM roles for tasks was added to the AWS SDKs on July 13th, 2016. The containers in your tasks must use an AWS SDK version that was created on or after that date. AWS SDKs that are included in Linux distribution package managers may not be new enough to support this feature.
To ensure that you are using a supported SDK, follow the installation instructions for your preferred SDK at Tools for Amazon Web Services when you are building your containers to get the latest version.
Specifying an IAM role for your tasks
After you have created a role and attached a policy to that role, you can run tasks that assume the role. You have several options to do this:
· Specify an IAM role for your tasks in the task definition. You can create a new task definition or a new revision of an existing task definition and specify the role you created previously. If you use the classic console to create your task definition, choose your IAM role in the Task Role field. If you use the AWS CLI or SDKs, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your task role using the taskRoleArn parameter. For more information, see Creating a task definition using the new console (p. 66).
364

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate CodeDeploy IAM Role
Note This option is required if you want to use IAM task roles in an Amazon ECS service.
· Specify an IAM task role override when running a task. You can specify an IAM task role override when running a task. If you use the classic console to run your task, choose Advanced Options and then choose your IAM role in the Task Role field. If you use the AWS CLI or SDKs, specify your task role ARN using the taskRoleArn parameter in the overrides JSON object. For more information, see Run a standalone task (p. 202).
Note In addition to the standard Amazon ECS permissions required to run tasks and services, IAM users also require iam:PassRole permissions to use IAM roles for tasks.
Amazon ECS CodeDeploy IAM Role
Before you can use the CodeDeploy blue/green deployment type with Amazon ECS, the CodeDeploy service needs permissions to update your Amazon ECS service on your behalf. These permissions are provided by the CodeDeploy IAM role (ecsCodeDeployRole).
Note IAM users also require permissions to use CodeDeploy; these permissions are described in Blue/ green deployment required IAM permissions (p. 246).
There are two managed policies provided. The AWSCodeDeployRoleForECS policy, shown below, gives CodeDeploy permission to update any resource using the associated action.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Action": [ "ecs:DescribeServices", "ecs:CreateTaskSet", "ecs:UpdateServicePrimaryTaskSet", "ecs:DeleteTaskSet", "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups", "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeListeners", "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyListener", "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeRules", "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyRule", "lambda:InvokeFunction", "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms", "sns:Publish", "s3:GetObject", "s3:GetObjectVersion" ], "Resource": "*", "Effect": "Allow" }, { "Action": [ "iam:PassRole" ], "Effect": "Allow", "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringLike": { "iam:PassedToService": [ "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com" ] }

Additional configuration for Windows IAM roles for tasks
The IAM roles for tasks with Windows features requires additional configuration, but much of this configuration is similar to confiuring IAM roles for tasks on Linux container instances. The following requirements must be met to configure IAM roles for tasks for Windows containers.
· When you launch your container instances, you must set the -EnableTaskIAMRole option in the container instances user data script. The EnableTaskIAMRole turns on the Task IAM roles feature for the tasks. For example:
<powershell> Import-Module ECSTools Initialize-ECSAgent -Cluster 'windows' -EnableTaskIAMRole </powershell>
371

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Additional configuration for Windows IAM roles for tasks
· You must bootstrap your container with the networking commands that are provided in IAM roles for task container bootstrap script (p. 372).
· You must create an IAM role and policy for your tasks. For more information, see Creating an IAM role and policy for your tasks (p. 361).
· Your container must use an AWS SDK that supports IAM roles for tasks. For more information, see Using a supported AWS SDK (p. 364).
· You must specify the IAM role you created for your tasks when you register the task definition, or as an override when you run the task. For more information, see Specifying an IAM role for your tasks (p. 364).
· The IAM roles for the task credential provider use port 80 on the container instance. Therefore, if you configure IAM roles for tasks on your container instance, your containers can't use port 80 for the host port in any port mappings. To expose your containers on port 80, we recommend configuring a service for them that uses load balancing. You can use port 80 on the load balancer. By doing so, traffic can be routed to another host port on your container instances. For more information, see Service load balancing (p. 252).
· If your Windows instance is restarted, you must delete the proxy interface and initialize the Amazon ECS container agent again to bring the credential proxy back up.
IAM roles for task container bootstrap script
Before containers can access the credential proxy on the container instance to get credentials, the container must be bootstrapped with the required networking commands. The following code example script should be run on your containers when they start.
Note You do not need to run this script when you use awsvpc network mode on Windows.
If you run Windows containers which include Powershell, then use the following script:

Troubleshooting Amazon Elastic Container Service identity and access
Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might encounter when working with Amazon ECS and IAM.
Topics · I am not authorized to perform an action in Amazon ECS (p. 373) · I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole (p. 373) · I want to view my access keys (p. 374) · I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access Amazon ECS (p. 374) · I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon ECS resources (p. 374)
I am not authorized to perform an action in Amazon ECS
If the AWS Management Console tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your user name and password.
The following example error occurs when the mateojackson IAM user tries to use the console to view details about a fictional my-example-widget resource but does not have the fictional ecs:GetWidget permissions.
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: ecs:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget
In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update his policies to allow him to access the my-examplewidget resource using the ecs:GetWidget action.
I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole
If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the iam:PassRole action, then you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your user name and password. Ask that person to update your policies to allow you to pass a role to Amazon ECS.
Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service, instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.
373

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Troubleshooting
The following example error occurs when an IAM user named marymajor tries to use the console to perform an action in Amazon ECS. However, the action requires the service to have permissions granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service.
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
In this case, Mary asks her administrator to update her policies to allow her to perform the iam:PassRole action.
I want to view my access keys
After you create your IAM user access keys, you can view your access key ID at any time. However, you can't view your secret access key again. If you lose your secret key, you must create a new access key pair.
Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). Like a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests. Manage your access keys as securely as you do your user name and password.
Important Do not provide your access keys to a third party, even to help find your canonical user ID. By doing this, you might give someone permanent access to your account.
When you create an access key pair, you are prompted to save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location. The secret access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you must add new access keys to your IAM user. You can have a maximum of two access keys. If you already have two, you must delete one key pair before creating a new one. To view instructions, see Managing access keys in the IAM User Guide.
I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access Amazon ECS
To allow others to access Amazon ECS, you must create an IAM entity (user or role) for the person or application that needs access. They will use the credentials for that entity to access AWS. You must then attach a policy to the entity that grants them the correct permissions in Amazon ECS.
To get started right away, see Creating your first IAM delegated user and group in the IAM User Guide.
I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon ECS resources
You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources.
To learn more, consult the following:
· To learn whether Amazon ECS supports these features, see How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM (p. 325).
· To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you own in the IAM User Guide.
· To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties in the IAM User Guide.
· To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation) in the IAM User Guide.

Logging and Monitoring in Amazon Elastic Container Service
Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon Elastic Container Service and your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your Amazon ECS resources and responding to potential incidents:
Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
Watch a single metric over a time period that you specify, and perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch metrics (p. 290).
For services with tasks that use the Fargate launch type, you can use CloudWatch alarms to scale in and scale out the tasks in your service based on CloudWatch metrics, such as CPU and memory utilization. For more information, see Service auto scaling (p. 263). Amazon CloudWatch Logs
Monitor, store, and access the log files from the containers in your Amazon ECS tasks by specifying the awslogs log driver in your task definitions. For more information, see Using the awslogs log driver (p. 138). Amazon CloudWatch Events
Match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams to make changes, capture state information, and take corrective action. For more information, see Amazon ECS events and EventBridge (p. 297) in this guide and What Is Amazon CloudWatch Events? in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. AWS CloudTrail Logs
CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon ECS. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon ECS, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. For more information, see Logging Amazon ECS API calls with AWS CloudTrail (p. 317). AWS Trusted Advisor
Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks. Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks.
For more information, see AWS Trusted Advisor in the AWS Support User Guide.
Another important part of monitoring Amazon ECS involves manually monitoring those items that the CloudWatch alarms don't cover. The CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor, and other AWS console dashboards

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Compliance Validation
provide an at-a-glance view of the state of your AWS environment. We recommend that you also check the log files on your container instances and the containers in your tasks.
Compliance Validation for Amazon Elastic Container Service
Third-party auditors assess the security and compliance of Amazon Elastic Container Service as part of multiple AWS compliance programs. These include SOC, PCI, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and others.
For a list of AWS services in scope of specific compliance programs, see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program. For general information, see AWS Compliance Programs.
You can download third-party audit reports using AWS Artifact. For more information, see Downloading reports in AWS Artifact.
Your compliance responsibility when using Amazon ECS is determined by the sensitivity of your data, your company's compliance objectives, and applicable laws and regulations. AWS provides the following resources to help with compliance:
· Security and Compliance Quick Start Guides ­ These deployment guides discuss architectural considerations and provide steps for deploying security- and compliance-focused baseline environments on AWS.
· Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance Whitepaper ­ This whitepaper describes how companies can use AWS to create HIPAA-compliant applications.
· AWS Compliance Resources ­ This collection of workbooks and guides might apply to your industry and location.
· AWS Config ­ This AWS service assesses how well your resource configurations comply with internal practices, industry guidelines, and regulations.
· AWS Security Hub ­ This AWS service provides a comprehensive view of your security state within AWS that helps you check your compliance with security industry standards and best practices.
Infrastructure Security in Amazon Elastic Container Service
As a managed service, Amazon Elastic Container Service is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes whitepaper.
You use AWS published API calls to access Amazon ECS through the network. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 or later. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.
Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
You can call these API operations from any network location. Amazon ECS supports resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address, so make sure that the policies account for the IP address for the network location. You can also use Amazon ECS policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud endpoints or specific VPCs. Effectively, this
376

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
isolates network access to a given Amazon ECS resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network. For more information, see Amazon ECS interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) (p. 377).
Amazon ECS interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring Amazon ECS to use an interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access Amazon ECS APIs by using private IP addresses. AWS PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your VPC and Amazon ECS to the Amazon network. You don't need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway.
For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Considerations for Amazon ECS VPC endpoints
Before you set up interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS, be aware of the following considerations:
· Tasks using the Fargate launch type don't require the interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS, but you might need interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR, Secrets Manager, or Amazon CloudWatch Logs described in the following points. · To allow your tasks to pull private images from Amazon ECR, you must create the interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR. For more information, see Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide. Important If you configure Amazon ECR to use an interface VPC endpoint, you can create a task execution role that includes condition keys to restrict access to a specific VPC or VPC endpoint. For more information, see Optional IAM permissions for Fargate tasks pulling Amazon ECR images over interface endpoints (p. 358). · To allow your tasks to pull sensitive data from Secrets Manager, you must create the interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager. For more information, see Using Secrets Manager with VPC Endpoints in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. · If your VPC doesn't have an internet gateway and your tasks use the awslogs log driver to send log information to CloudWatch Logs, you must create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see Using CloudWatch Logs with Interface VPC Endpoints in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
· VPC endpoints currently don't support cross-Region requests. Ensure that you create your endpoint in the same Region where you plan to issue your API calls to Amazon ECS.
· VPC endpoints only support Amazon-provided DNS through Amazon Route 53. If you want to use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding. For more information, see DHCP Options Sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
· The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming connections on port 443 from the private subnet of the VPC.
Creating the VPC Endpoints for Amazon ECS
To create the VPC endpoint for the Amazon ECS service, use the Creating an Interface Endpoint procedure in the Amazon VPC User Guide to create the following endpoints. If you have existing container instances within your VPC, you should create the endpoints in the order that they're listed. If you plan on creating your container instances after your VPC endpoint is created, the order doesn't matter.
· com.amazonaws.region.ecs-agent
377

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
· com.amazonaws.region.ecs-telemetry · com.amazonaws.region.ecs
Note region represents the Region identifier for an AWS Region supported by Amazon ECS, such as us-east-2 for the US East (Ohio) Region.
Create the Secrets Manager and Systems Manager endpoints
If you are referencing either Secrets Manager secrets or Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters in your task definitions to inject sensitive data into your containers, you need to create the interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager or Systems Manager so those tasks can reach those services. You only need to create the endpoints from the specific service your sensitive data is hosted in. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data (p. 176).
For more information about Secrets Manager VPC endpoints, see Using Secrets Manager with VPC endpoints in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
For more information about Systems Manager VPC endpoints, see Using Systems Manager with VPC endpoints in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
Create the Systems Manager Session Manager VPC endpoints when using the ECS Exec feature
If you use the ECS Exec feature, you need to create the interface VPC endpoints for Systems Manager Session Manager. For more information, see Using Amazon ECS Exec for debugging (p. 433).
For more information about Systems Manager Session Manager VPC endpoints, see Use AWS PrivateLink to set up a VPC endpoint for Session Manager in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
Creating a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon ECS
You can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access to Amazon ECS. The policy specifies the following information:
· The principal that can perform actions. · The actions that can be performed. · The resources on which actions can be performed.
For more information, see Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Example: VPC endpoint policy for Amazon ECS actions
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for Amazon ECS. When attached to an endpoint, this policy grants access to permission to create and list clusters. The CreateCluster and ListClusters actions do not accept any resources, so the resource definition is set to * for all resources.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Task metadata endpoint v4
Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint
Important If you are using Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, see Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Amazon ECS on Fargate provides a method to retrieve various metadata, network metrics, and Docker stats about your containers and the tasks they are a part of. This is referred to as the task metadata endpoint. The following task metadata endpoint versions are available for Amazon ECS on Fargate tasks:
· Task metadata endpoint version 4 ­ Available for tasks that use platform version 1.4.0 or later. · Task metadata endpoint version 3 ­ Available for tasks that use platform version 1.1.0 or later.
All containers belonging to tasks that are launched with the awsvpc network mode receive a local IPv4 address within a predefined link-local address range. When a container queries the metadata endpoint, the container agent can determine which task the container belongs to based on its unique IP address, and metadata and stats for that task are returned.
Topics · Task metadata endpoint version 4 (p. 380) · Task metadata endpoint version 3 (p. 389)
Task metadata endpoint version 4
Important If you are using Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, see Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Beginning with Fargate platform version 1.4.0, an environment variable named ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4 is injected into each container in a task. When you query the task metadata endpoint version 4, various task metadata and Docker stats are available to tasks.
The task metadata endpoint version 4 functions like the version 3 endpoint but provides additional network metadata for your containers and tasks. Additional network metrics are available when querying the /stats endpoints as well.
Note To avoid the need to create new task metadata endpoint versions in the future, additional metadata may be added to the version 4 output. We will not remove any existing metadata or change the metadata field names.
Enabling the task metadata endpoint
The task metadata endpoint is enabled by default for all Amazon ECS tasks run on AWS Fargate that use platform version 1.4.0 or later.
Task metadata endpoint version 4 paths
The following task metadata endpoints are available to containers:
380

Task metadata endpoint version 3
Important If you are using Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, see Amazon ECS task metadata endpoint in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Beginning with Fargate platform version 1.1.0, an environment variable named ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI is injected into each container in a task. When you query the task metadata version 3 endpoint, various task metadata and Docker stats are available to tasks.
Enabling Task Metadata
The task metadata endpoint feature is enabled by default for Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that use platform version 1.1.0 or later. For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions (p. 58).
Task Metadata Endpoint Paths
The following API endpoints are available to containers:
${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI}
This path returns metadata JSON for the container. ${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI}/task
This path returns metadata JSON for the task, including a list of the container IDs and names for all of the containers associated with the task. For more information about the response for this endpoint, see Task Metadata JSON Response (p. 389). ${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI}/stats
This path returns Docker stats JSON for the specific Docker container. For more information about each of the returned stats, see ContainerStats in the Docker API documentation. ${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI}/task/stats
This path returns Docker stats JSON for all of the containers associated with the task. For more information about each of the returned stats, see ContainerStats in the Docker API documentation.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Amazon ECR with Amazon ECS
AWS services integrated with Amazon ECS
Amazon ECS works with other AWS services to provide additional solutions for your business challenges. This topic identifies services that either use Amazon ECS to add functionality, or services that Amazon ECS uses to perform tasks.
Contents · Using Amazon ECR with Amazon ECS (p. 394) · Creating Amazon ECS resources with AWS CloudFormation (p. 395) · Use App Mesh with Amazon ECS (p. 395)
Using Amazon ECR with Amazon ECS
Amazon ECR is a managed AWS Docker registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry. Amazon ECR supports private Docker repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images. Developers can use the Docker CLI to author and manage images.
For more information on how to create repositories, push and pull images from Amazon ECR, and set access controls on your repositories, see the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.
Using Amazon ECR Images with Amazon ECS
You can use your ECR images with Amazon ECS, but you need to satisfy the following prerequisites.
· Your container instances must be using at least version 1.7.0 of the Amazon ECS container agent. The latest version of the Amazon ECS­optimized AMI supports ECR images in task definitions. For more information, including the latest Amazon ECS­optimized AMI IDs, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
· The Amazon ECS container instance role (ecsInstanceRole) that you use with your container instances must possess the following IAM policy permissions for Amazon ECR.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability", "ecr:BatchGetImage", "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer", "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken" ], "Resource": "*" } ]
}
394

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Creating Amazon ECS resources with AWS CloudFormation
If you use the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role managed policy for your container instances, then your role has the proper permissions. To check that your role supports Amazon ECR, see Amazon ECS Container Instance IAM Role in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. · In your ECS task definitions, make sure that you are using the full registry/repository:tag naming for your ECR images. For example, aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-web-app:latest.
Creating Amazon ECS resources with AWS CloudFormation
Amazon ECS is integrated with AWS CloudFormation, a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your resources and infrastructure. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want, for example an Amazon ECS cluster, and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
When you use AWS CloudFormation, you can reuse your template to set up your Amazon ECS resources consistently and repeatedly. Just describe your resources once, and then provision the same resources over and over in multiple AWS accounts and Regions.
Amazon ECS and AWS CloudFormation templates
To provision and configure resources for Amazon ECS and related services, you must understand AWS CloudFormation templates. Templates are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. These templates describe the resources that you want to provision in your AWS CloudFormation stacks. If you're unfamiliar with JSON or YAML, you can use AWS CloudFormation Designer to help you get started with AWS CloudFormation templates. For more information, see What is AWS CloudFormation Designer? in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
Amazon ECS supports creating clusters, task definitions, services, and task sets in AWS CloudFormation. For more information, including examples of JSON and YAML templates for your Amazon ECS resources, see Amazon ECS resource type reference in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

Use App Mesh with Amazon ECS
App Mesh is a service mesh that makes it easy to monitor and control services. App Mesh standardizes how your services communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high availability for your applications. App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every service in an application. You can get started using App Mesh with Amazon ECS by completing the Getting started with AWS App Mesh and Amazon ECS tutorial in the AWS App Mesh User Guide. The tutorial recommends that you have existing services deployed to Amazon ECS that you want to use App Mesh with.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a
Fargate Linux task using the AWS CLI
Tutorials for Amazon ECS
The following tutorials show you how to perform common tasks when using Amazon ECS.
Topics · Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate Linux task using the AWS CLI (p. 397) · Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate Windows task using the AWS CLI (p. 403) · Tutorial: Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager secrets (p. 408) · Tutorial: Creating a service using Service Discovery (p. 413) · Tutorial: Creating a service using a blue/green deployment (p. 420) · Tutorial: Listening for Amazon ECS CloudWatch Events (p. 429) · Tutorial: Sending Amazon Simple Notification Service alerts for task stopped events (p. 430)
Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate Linux task using the AWS CLI
The following steps help you set up a cluster, register a task definition, run a Linux task, and perform other common scenarios in Amazon ECS with the AWS CLI. Ensure that you are using the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more information on how to upgrade to the latest version, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface.
Topics · Prerequisites (p. 397) · Step 1: Create a Cluster (p. 398) · Step 2: Register a Linux Task Definition (p. 398) · Step 3: List Task Definitions (p. 399) · Step 4: Create a Service (p. 399) · Step 5: List Services (p. 400) · Step 6: Describe the Running Service (p. 400) · Step 7: Test (p. 402) · Step 8: Clean Up (p. 403)
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been completed.
· The latest version of the AWS CLI is installed and configured. For more information about installing or upgrading your AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface.
· The steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) have been completed. · Your AWS user has the required permissions specified in the Amazon ECS first-run wizard
permissions (p. 333) IAM policy example. · You have a VPC and security group created to use. This tutorial uses a container image hosted on
Amazon ECR Public so your task must have internet access. To give your task a route to the internet, use one of the following options.
397

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 1: Create a Cluster
· Use a private subnet with a NAT gateway that has an elastic IP address. · Use a public subnet and assign a public IP address to the task.
For more information, see the section called "Create a virtual private cloud" (p. 6). · Optional: AWS CloudShell is a tool that gives customers a command line without needing to create
their own EC2 instance. For more information, see What is AWS CloudShell in the AWS CloudShell User Guide.
Step 1: Create a Cluster
By default, your account receives a default cluster. Note The benefit of using the default cluster that is provided for you is that you don't have to specify the --cluster cluster_name option in the subsequent commands. If you do create your own, non-default, cluster, you must specify --cluster cluster_name for each command that you intend to use with that cluster.
Create your own cluster with a unique name with the following command:
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name fargate-cluster
Output:
{ "cluster": { "status": "ACTIVE", "statistics": [], "clusterName": "fargate-cluster", "registeredContainerInstancesCount": 0, "pendingTasksCount": 0, "runningTasksCount": 0, "activeServicesCount": 0, "clusterArn": "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:cluster/fargate-cluster" }
}
Step 2: Register a Linux Task Definition
Before you can run a task on your ECS cluster, you must register a task definition. Task definitions are lists of containers grouped together. The following example is a simple task definition that creates a PHP web app using the httpd container image hosted on Docker Hub. For more information about the available task definition parameters, see Amazon ECS task definitions (p. 85).
{ "family": "sample-fargate", "networkMode": "awsvpc", "containerDefinitions": [ { "name": "fargate-app", "image": "public.ecr.aws/docker/library/httpd:latest", "portMappings": [ { "containerPort": 80, "hostPort": 80, "protocol": "tcp"
398

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 3: List Task Definitions
} ], "essential": true, "entryPoint": [
"sh", "-c"
], "command": [
"/bin/sh -c \"echo '<html> <head> <title>Amazon ECS Sample App</title> <style>body {margin-top: 40px; background-color: #333;} </style> </head><body> <div style=color:white;text-align:center> <h1>Amazon ECS Sample App</h1> <h2>Congratulations! </h2> <p>Your application is now running on a container in Amazon ECS.</p> </div></body></ html>' > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html && httpd-foreground\""
] } ], "requiresCompatibilities": [ "FARGATE" ], "cpu": "256", "memory": "512" }
The above example JSON can be passed to the AWS CLI in two ways: You can save the task definition JSON as a file and pass it with the --cli-input-json file://path_to_file.json option. Or, you can escape the quotation marks in the JSON and pass the JSON container definitions on the command line as in the below example. If you choose to pass the container definitions on the command line, your command additionally requires a --family parameter that is used to keep multiple versions of your task definition associated with each other.
To use a JSON file for container definitions:
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://$HOME/tasks/fargate-task.json
The register-task-definition command returns a description of the task definition after it completes its registration.
Step 3: List Task Definitions
You can list the task definitions for your account at any time with the list-task-definitions command. The output of this command shows the family and revision values that you can use together when calling run-task or start-task.
aws ecs list-task-definitions
Output:
{ "taskDefinitionArns": [ "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:task-definition/sample-fargate:1" ]
}
Step 4: Create a Service
After you have registered a task for your account, you can create a service for the registered task in your cluster. For this example, you create a service with one instance of the sample-fargate:1 task
399

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 5: List Services
definition running in your cluster. The task requires a route to the internet, so there are two ways you can achieve this. One way is to use a private subnet configured with a NAT gateway with an elastic IP address in a public subnet. Another way is to use a public subnet and assign a public IP address to your task. We provide both examples below.
Example using a private subnet.
aws ecs create-service --cluster fargate-cluster --service-name fargate-service -task-definition sample-fargate:1 --desired-count 1 --launch-type "FARGATE" --networkconfiguration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abcd1234],securityGroups=[sgabcd1234]}"
Example using a public subnet.
aws ecs create-service --cluster fargate-cluster --service-name fargate-service -task-definition sample-fargate:1 --desired-count 1 --launch-type "FARGATE" --networkconfiguration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abcd1234],securityGroups=[sgabcd1234],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}"
The create-service command returns a description of the task definition after it completes its registration.
Step 5: List Services
List the services for your cluster. You should see the service that you created in the previous section. You can take the service name or the full ARN that is returned from this command and use it to describe the service later.
aws ecs list-services --cluster fargate-cluster
Output:
{ "serviceArns": [ "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/fargate-service" ]
}
Step 6: Describe the Running Service
Describe the service using the service name retrieved earlier to get more information about the task.
aws ecs describe-services --cluster fargate-cluster --services fargate-service
If successful, this will return a description of the service failures and services. For example, in services section, you will find information on deployments, such as the status of the tasks as running or pending. You may also find information on the task definition, the network configuration and time-stamped events. In the failures section, you will find information on failures, if any, associated with the call. For troubleshooting, see Service Event Messages. For more information about the service description, see Describe Services.

Tutorial: Creating a cluster with a Fargate Windows task using the AWS CLI
The following steps help you set up a cluster, register a task definition, run a Windows task, and perform other common scenarios in Amazon ECS with the AWS CLI. Ensure that you are using the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more information on how to upgrade to the latest version, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface. Topics
· Prerequisites (p. 403) · Step 1: Create a Cluster (p. 404) · Step 2: Register a Windows Task Definition (p. 404) · Step 3: List task definitions (p. 405) · Step 4: Create a service (p. 406) · Step 5: List services (p. 406) · Step 6: Describe the Running Service (p. 406) · Step 7: Clean Up (p. 408)
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been completed. · The latest version of the AWS CLI is installed and configured. For more information about installing or
upgrading your AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface. · The steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) have been completed.
403

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 1: Create a Cluster
· Your AWS user has the required permissions specified in the Amazon ECS first-run wizard permissions (p. 333) IAM policy example.
· You have a VPC and security group created to use. This tutorial uses a container image hosted on Docker Hub so your task must have internet access. To give your task a route to the internet, use one of the following options. · Use a private subnet with a NAT gateway that has an elastic IP address. · Use a public subnet and assign a public IP address to the task.
For more information, see the section called "Create a virtual private cloud" (p. 6). · Optional: AWS CloudShell is a tool that gives customers a command line without needing to create
their own EC2 instance. For more information, see What is AWS CloudShell in the AWS CloudShell User Guide.
Step 1: Create a Cluster
By default, your account receives a default cluster. Note The benefit of using the default cluster that is provided for you is that you don't have to specify the --cluster cluster_name option in the subsequent commands. If you do create your own, non-default, cluster, you must specify --cluster cluster_name for each command that you intend to use with that cluster.
Create your own cluster with a unique name with the following command:
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name fargate-cluster
Output:
{ "cluster": { "status": "ACTIVE", "statistics": [], "clusterName": "fargate-cluster", "registeredContainerInstancesCount": 0, "pendingTasksCount": 0, "runningTasksCount": 0, "activeServicesCount": 0, "clusterArn": "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:cluster/fargate-cluster" }
}
Step 2: Register a Windows Task Definition
Before you can run a Windows task on your Amazon ECS cluster, you must register a task definition. Task definitions are lists of containers grouped together. The following example is a simple task definition that creates a web app. For more information about the available task definition parameters, see Amazon ECS task definitions (p. 85).
{ "containerDefinitions": [ { "command": [ "New-Item -Path C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\index.html -Type file -Value '<html>
<head> <title>Amazon ECS Sample App</title> <style>body {margin-top: 40px; background-
404

color: #333;} </style> </head><body> <div style=color:white;text-align:center> <h1>Amazon ECS Sample App</h1> <h2>Congratulations!</h2> <p>Your application is now running on a container in Amazon ECS.</p>'; C:\\ServiceMonitor.exe w3svc" ], "entryPoint": [ "powershell", "-Command" ], "essential": true, "cpu": 2048, "memory": 4096, "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-ltsc2019", "logConfiguration": { "logDriver": "awslogs", "options": { "awslogs-group": "/ecs/fargate-windows-task-definition", "awslogs-region": "us-east-1", "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs" } }, "name": "sample_windows_app", "portMappings": [ { "hostPort": 80, "containerPort": 80, "protocol": "tcp" } ] } ], "memory": "4096", "cpu": "2048", "networkMode": "awsvpc", "family": "windows-simple-iis-2019-core", "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::012345678910:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole", "runtimePlatform": { "operatingSystemFamily": "WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE" }, "requiresCompatibilities": [ "FARGATE" ]
}
The above example JSON can be passed to the AWS CLI in two ways: You can save the task definition JSON as a file and pass it with the --cli-input-json file://path_to_file.json option.
To use a JSON file for container definitions:
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://$HOME/tasks/fargate-task.json
The register-task-definition command returns a description of the task definition after it completes its registration.
Step 3: List task definitions
You can list the task definitions for your account at any time with the list-task-definitions command. The output of this command shows the family and revision values that you can use together when calling run-task or start-task.
aws ecs list-task-definitions
405

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 4: Create a service
Output:
{ "taskDefinitionArns": [ "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:task-definition/sample-fargate-windows:1" ]
}
Step 4: Create a service
After you have registered a task for your account, you can create a service for the registered task in your cluster. For this example, you create a service with one instance of the sample-fargate:1 task definition running in your cluster. The task requires a route to the internet, so there are two ways you can achieve this. One way is to use a private subnet configured with a NAT gateway with an elastic IP address in a public subnet. Another way is to use a public subnet and assign a public IP address to your task. We provide both examples below.
Example using a private subnet.
aws ecs create-service --cluster fargate-cluster --service-name fargate-service -task-definition sample-fargate-windows:1 --desired-count 1 --launch-type "FARGATE" -network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abcd1234],securityGroups=[sgabcd1234]}"
Example using a public subnet.
aws ecs create-service --cluster fargate-cluster --service-name fargate-service -task-definition sample-fargate-windows:1 --desired-count 1 --launch-type "FARGATE" -network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abcd1234],securityGroups=[sgabcd1234],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}"
The create-service command returns a description of the task definition after it completes its registration.
Step 5: List services
List the services for your cluster. You should see the service that you created in the previous section. You can take the service name or the full ARN that is returned from this command and use it to describe the service later.
aws ecs list-services --cluster fargate-cluster
Output:
{ "serviceArns": [ "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/fargate-service" ]
}
Step 6: Describe the Running Service
Describe the service using the service name retrieved earlier to get more information about the task.
406

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 6: Describe the Running Service
aws ecs describe-services --cluster fargate-cluster --services fargate-service
If successful, this will return a description of the service failures and services. For example, in services section, you will find information on deployments, such as the status of the tasks as running or pending. You may also find information on the task definition, the network configuration and time-stamped events. In the failures section, you will find information on failures, if any, associated with the call. For troubleshooting, see Service Event Messages.

Tutorial: Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager secrets
Amazon ECS enables you to inject sensitive data into your containers by storing your sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager secrets and then referencing them in your container definition. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data (p. 176).
The following tutorial shows how to create an Secrets Manager secret, reference the secret in an Amazon ECS task definition, and then verify it worked by querying the environment variable inside a container showing the contents of the secret.
408

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Prerequisites
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been completed:
· The steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) have been completed. · Your AWS user has the required IAM permissions to create the Secrets Manager and Amazon ECS
resources described.
Step 1: Create an Secrets Manager secret
You can use the Secrets Manager console to create a secret for your sensitive data. In this tutorial we will be creating a basic secret for storing a username and password to reference later in a container. For more information, see Creating a Basic Secret in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
To create a basic secret
Use Secrets Manager to create a secret for your sensitive data.
1. Open the Secrets Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/. 2. Choose Store a new secret. 3. For Select secret type, choose Other type of secrets. 4. For Specify the key/value pairs to be stored in this secret, choose the Plaintext tab and replace
the existing text with the following text. The text value you specify here will be the environment variable value in your container at the end of the tutorial.
password_value
5. Choose Next. 6. For Secret name, type username_value and choose Next. The secret name value you specify here
will be the environment variable name in your container at the end of the tutorial. 7. For Configure automatic rotation, leave Disable automatic rotation selected and choose Next. 8. Review these settings, and then choose Store to save everything you entered as a new secret in
Secrets Manager. 9. Select the secret you just created and save the Secret ARN to reference in your task execution IAM
policy and task definition in later steps.
Step 2: Update your task execution IAM role
In order for Amazon ECS to retrieve the sensitive data from your Secrets Manager secret, you must have the Amazon ECS task execution role and reference it in your task definition. This allows the container agent to pull the necessary Secrets Manager resources. If you have not already created your task execution IAM role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354).
The following steps assume you already have the task execution IAM role created and properly configured.
To update your task execution IAM role
Use the IAM console to update your task execution role with the required permissions.
1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
409

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 3: Create an Amazon ECS task definition
2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles. 3. Search the list of roles for ecsTaskExecutionRole and select it. 4. Choose Permissions, Add inline policy. 5. Choose the JSON tab and specify the following JSON text, ensuring that you specify the full ARN of
the Secrets Manager secret you created in step 1.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:aws_account_id:secret:username_value-
u9bH6K" ]
} ] }
6. Choose Review policy. For Name specify ECSSecretsTutorial, then choose Create policy.
Step 3: Create an Amazon ECS task definition
You can use the Amazon ECS console to create a task definition that references a Secrets Manager secret.
To create a task definition that specifies a secret
Use the IAM console to update your task execution role with the required permissions.
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions, Create new Task Definition. 3. On the Select launch type compatibility page, choose EC2 and choose Next step. 4. Choose Configure via JSON and enter the following task definition JSON text, ensuring that you
specify the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret you created in step 1 and the task execution IAM role you updated in step 2. Choose Save.
{ "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole", "containerDefinitions": [ { "entryPoint": [ "sh", "-c" ], "portMappings": [ { "hostPort": 80, "protocol": "tcp", "containerPort": 80 } ], "command": [ "/bin/sh -c \"echo '<html> <head> <title>Amazon ECS Sample

5. Review the settings and then choose Create.
Step 4: Create an Amazon ECS cluster
You can use the Amazon ECS console to create a cluster containing a container instance to run the task on. If you have an existing cluster with at least one container instance registered to it with the available resources to run one instance of the task definition created for this tutorial you can skip to the next step.
For this tutorial we will be creating a cluster with one t2.micro container instance using the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
To create a cluster
Use the Amazon ECS console to create a cluster and register one container instance to it.
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. From the navigation bar, select the Region that contains both the Secrets Manager secret and the
Amazon ECS task definition you created. 3. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 4. On the Clusters page, choose Create Cluster. 5. For Select cluster compatibility, choose EC2 Linux + Networking, then choose Next step. 6. On the Configure cluster page, for Cluster name enter ecs-secrets-tutorial. 7. For EC2 instance type, choose t2.micro. 8. For Key pair, choose a key pair to add to the container instance.
Important A key pair is required to complete the tutorial, so if you do not already have a key pair created follow the link to the EC2 console to create one. 9. In the Networking section, configure the VPC for your cluster. Select an existing VPC or you can choose Create a new VPC to use for the tutorial.
a. (Optional) If you choose to create a new VPC, for CIDR Block, select a CIDR block for your VPC. For more information, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
b. For Subnets, select the subnets to use for your VPC. You can keep the default settings or you can modify them to meet your needs.
10. For Container instance IAM role, choose your existing container instance IAM role or select Create new role to have one created for you.
411

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 5: Run an Amazon ECS task
11. Leave all other fields at their default values and choose Create.
Step 5: Run an Amazon ECS task
You can use the Amazon ECS console to run a task using the task definition you created. For this tutorial we will be running a task using the EC2 launch type, using the cluster we created in the previous step.
To run a task
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions and select the ecs-secrets-tutorial task definition
we created. 3. Select the latest revision of the task definition and then choose Actions, Run Task. 4. For Launch Type, choose EC2. 5. For Cluster, choose the ecs-secrets-tutorial cluster we created in the previous step. 6. For Task tagging configuration, deselect Enable ECS managed tags. They are unnecessary for the
purposes of this tutorial. 7. Review your task information and choose Run Task.
Note If your task moves from PENDING to STOPPED, or if it displays a PENDING status and then disappears from the listed tasks, your task may be stopping due to an error. For more information, see Checking stopped tasks for errors (p. 442) in the troubleshooting section.
Step 6: Verify
You can verify all of the steps were completed successfully and the environment variable was created properly in your container using the following steps.
To verify that the environment variable was created
1. Find the public IP or DNS address for your container instance.
a. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. b. Select the ecs-secrets-tutorial cluster that hosts your container instance. c. On the Cluster page, choose ECS Instances. d. On the Container Instance column, select the container instance to connect to. e. On the Container Instance page, record the Public IP or Public DNS for your instance. 2. If you are using a macOS or Linux computer, connect to your instance with the following command, substituting the path to your private key and the public address for your instance:
$ ssh -i /path/to/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
For more information about using a Windows computer, see Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Important For more information about any issues while connecting to your instance, see Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. 3. List the containers running on the instance. Note the container ID for ecs-secrets-tutorial container.

"Create a virtual private cloud" (p. 6).
Step 1: Create the Service Discovery resources in AWS Cloud Map
Follow these steps to create your service discovery namespace and service discovery service:
1. Create a private Cloud Map service discovery namespace. This example creates a namespace that's called tutorial. Replace vpc-abcd1234 with the ID of one of your existing VPCs.
aws servicediscovery create-private-dns-namespace \ --name tutorial \ --vpc vpc-abcd1234
The output of this command is as follows.
{ "OperationId": "h2qe3s6dxftvvt7riu6lfy2f6c3jlhf4-je6chs2e"
}
2. Using the OperationId from the output of the previous step, verify that the private namespace was created successfully. Make note of the namespace ID because you use it in subsequent commands.
aws servicediscovery get-operation \ --operation-id h2qe3s6dxftvvt7riu6lfy2f6c3jlhf4-je6chs2e
The output is as follows.
{ "Operation": { "Id": "h2qe3s6dxftvvt7riu6lfy2f6c3jlhf4-je6chs2e", "Type": "CREATE_NAMESPACE", "Status": "SUCCESS", "CreateDate": 1519777852.502, "UpdateDate": 1519777856.086, "Targets": { "NAMESPACE": "ns-uejictsjen2i4eeg" } }
}
414

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 2: Create the Amazon ECS resources
3. Using the NAMESPACE ID from the output of the previous step, create a service discovery service. This example creates a service named myapplication. Make note of the service ID and ARN because you use them in subsequent commands.
aws servicediscovery create-service \ --name myapplication \ --dns-config "NamespaceId="ns-
uejictsjen2i4eeg",DnsRecords=[{Type="A",TTL="300"}]" \ --health-check-custom-config FailureThreshold=1
The output is as follows.
{ "Service": { "Id": "srv-utcrh6wavdkggqtk", "Arn": "arn:aws:servicediscovery:region:aws_account_id:service/srv-
utcrh6wavdkggqtk", "Name": "myapplication", "DnsConfig": { "NamespaceId": "ns-uejictsjen2i4eeg", "DnsRecords": [ { "Type": "A", "TTL": 300 } ] }, "HealthCheckCustomConfig": { "FailureThreshold": 1 }, "CreatorRequestId": "e49a8797-b735-481b-a657-b74d1d6734eb"
} }
Step 2: Create the Amazon ECS resources
Follow these steps to create your Amazon ECS cluster, task definition, and service:
1. Create an Amazon ECS cluster. This example creates a cluster that's named tutorial.
aws ecs create-cluster \ --cluster-name tutorial
2. Register a task definition that's compatible with Fargate and uses the awsvpc network mode. Follow these steps:
a. Create a file that's named fargate-task.json with the contents of the following task definition.
{ "family": "tutorial-task-def", "networkMode": "awsvpc", "containerDefinitions": [ { "name": "sample-app", "image": "httpd:2.4", "portMappings": [ { "containerPort": 80,

b. Register the task definition using fargate-task.json.
aws ecs register-task-definition \ --cli-input-json file://fargate-task.json
3. Create an ECS service by following these steps:
a. Create a file that's named ecs-service-discovery.json with the contents of the ECS service that you're creating. This example uses the task definition that was created in the previous step. An awsvpcConfiguration is required because the example task definition uses the awsvpc network mode.
When you create the ECS service, specify the Fargate launch type, and the LATEST platform version that supports service discovery. When the service discovery service is created in AWS Cloud Map , registryArn is the ARN returned. The securityGroups and subnets must belong to the VPC that's used to create the Cloud Map namespace. You can obtain the security group and subnet IDs from the Amazon VPC Console.
{ "cluster": "tutorial", "serviceName": "ecs-service-discovery", "taskDefinition": "tutorial-task-def", "serviceRegistries": [ { "registryArn":
"arn:aws:servicediscovery:region:aws_account_id:service/srv-utcrh6wavdkggqtk" }
], "launchType": "FARGATE", "platformVersion": "LATEST", "networkConfiguration": {
"awsvpcConfiguration": { "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED", "securityGroups": [ "sg-abcd1234" ], "subnets": [ "subnet-abcd1234" ]
} },
416

"desiredCount": 1 }
b. Create your ECS service using ecs-service-discovery.json.
aws ecs create-service \ --cli-input-json file://ecs-service-discovery.json
Step 3: Verify Service Discovery in AWS Cloud Map
You can verify that everything is created properly by querying your service discovery information. After service discovery is configured, you can either use AWS Cloud Map API operations, or call dig from an instance within your VPC. Follow these steps:
1. Using the service discovery service ID, list the service discovery instances. Make note of the instance ID (marked in bold) for resource cleanup.
aws servicediscovery list-instances \ --service-id srv-utcrh6wavdkggqtk
The output is as follows.
{ "Instances": [ { "Id": "16becc26-8558-4af1-9fbd-f81be062a266", "Attributes": { "AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4": "172.31.87.2" "AWS_INSTANCE_PORT": "80", "AVAILABILITY_ZONE": "us-east-1a", "REGION": "us-east-1", "ECS_SERVICE_NAME": "ecs-service-discovery", "ECS_CLUSTER_NAME": "tutorial", "ECS_TASK_DEFINITION_FAMILY": "tutorial-task-def" } } ]
}
2. Use the service discovery namespace, service, and additional parameters such as ECS cluster name to query details about the service discovery instances.
aws servicediscovery discover-instances \ --namespace-name tutorial \ --service-name myapplication \ --query-parameters ECS_CLUSTER_NAME=tutorial
3. The DNS records that are created in the Route 53 hosted zone for the service discovery service can be queried with the following AWS CLI commands:
a. Using the namespace ID, get information about the namespace, which includes the Route 53 hosted zone ID.
aws servicediscovery \ get-namespace --id ns-uejictsjen2i4eeg
The output is as follows.

} }
b. Using the Route 53 hosted zone ID from the previous step (see the text in bold), get the resource record set for the hosted zone.
aws route53 list-resource-record-sets \ --hosted-zone-id Z35JQ4ZFDRYPLV
4. You can also query the DNS from an instance within your VPC using dig.
dig +short myapplication.tutorial
Step 4: Clean up
When you're finished with this tutorial, clean up the associated resources to avoid incurring charges for unused resources. Follow these steps:
1. Deregister the service discovery service instances using the service ID and instance ID that you noted previously.
aws servicediscovery deregister-instance \ --service-id srv-utcrh6wavdkggqtk \ --instance-id 16becc26-8558-4af1-9fbd-f81be062a266
The output is as follows.
{ "OperationId": "xhu73bsertlyffhm3faqi7kumsmx274n-jh0zimzv"
}
2. Using the OperationId from the output of the previous step, verify that the service discovery service instances were deregistered successfully.
aws servicediscovery get-operation \ --operation-id xhu73bsertlyffhm3faqi7kumsmx274n-jh0zimzv
{ "Operation": { "Id": "xhu73bsertlyffhm3faqi7kumsmx274n-jh0zimzv", "Type": "DEREGISTER_INSTANCE", "Status": "SUCCESS",

Tutorial: Creating a service using a blue/green deployment
Amazon ECS has integrated blue/green deployments into the Create Service wizard on the Amazon ECS console. For more information, see Creating an Amazon ECS service (p. 226).
The following tutorial shows how to create an Amazon ECS service containing a Fargate task that uses the blue/green deployment type with the AWS CLI.
Note Support for performing a blue/green deployment has been added for AWS CloudFormation. For more information, see Perform Amazon ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy using AWS CloudFormation in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have completed the following prerequisites:
· The latest version of the AWS CLI is installed and configured. For more information about installing or upgrading the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface.
· The steps in Set up to use Amazon ECS (p. 4) have been completed. · Your AWS user has the required permissions specified in the Amazon ECS first-run wizard
permissions (p. 333) IAM policy example. · You have a VPC and security group created to use. For more information, see the section called "Create
a virtual private cloud" (p. 6). · The Amazon ECS CodeDeploy IAM role is created. For more information, see Amazon ECS CodeDeploy
IAM Role (p. 365).
Step 1: Create an Application Load Balancer
Amazon ECS services using the blue/green deployment type require the use of either an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer. This tutorial uses an Application Load Balancer.
To create an Application Load Balancer
1. Use the create-load-balancer command to create an Application Load Balancer. Specify two subnets that aren't from the same Availability Zone as well as a security group.
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \ --name bluegreen-alb \ --subnets subnet-abcd1234 subnet-abcd5678 \ --security-groups sg-abcd1234 \
420

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Step 2: Create an Amazon ECS cluster
--region us-east-1
The output includes the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer, with the following format:
arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:aws_account_id:loadbalancer/app/bluegreen-alb/ e5ba62739c16e642
2. Use the create-target-group command to create a target group. This target group will route traffic to the original task set in your service.
aws elbv2 create-target-group \ --name bluegreentarget1 \ --protocol HTTP \ --port 80 \ --target-type ip \ --vpc-id vpc-abcd1234 \ --region us-east-1
The output includes the ARN of the target group, with the following format:
arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:aws_account_id:targetgroup/ bluegreentarget1/209a844cd01825a4
3. Use the create-listener command to create a load balancer listener with a default rule that forwards requests to the target group.
aws elbv2 create-listener \ --load-balancer-arn
arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:aws_account_id:loadbalancer/app/bluegreen-alb/ e5ba62739c16e642 \
--protocol HTTP \ --port 80 \ --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:aws_account_id:targetgroup/ bluegreentarget1/209a844cd01825a4 \ --region us-east-1

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Tutorial: Listening for Amazon ECS CloudWatch Events
Tutorial: Listening for Amazon ECS CloudWatch Events
In this tutorial, you set up a simple AWS Lambda function that listens for Amazon ECS task events and writes them out to a CloudWatch Logs log stream.
Prerequisite: Set up a test cluster
If you do not have a running cluster to capture events from, follow the steps in Creating a cluster using the classic console (p. 77) to create one. At the end of this tutorial, you run a task on this cluster to test that you have configured your Lambda function correctly.
Step 1: Create the Lambda function
In this procedure, you create a simple Lambda function to serve as a target for Amazon ECS event stream messages.
1. Open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/. 2. Choose Create function. 3. On the Author from scratch screen, do the following:
a. For Name, enter a value. b. For Runtime, choose your version of Python, for example, Python 3.9. c. For Role, choose Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions. 4. Choose Create function. 5. In the Function code section, edit the sample code to match the following example:
import json
def lambda_handler(event, context): if event["source"] != "aws.ecs": raise ValueError("Function only supports input from events with a source type
of: aws.ecs")
print('Here is the event:') print(json.dumps(event))
This is a simple Python 3.9 function that prints the event sent by Amazon ECS. If everything is configured correctly, at the end of this tutorial, you see that the event details appear in the CloudWatch Logs log stream associated with this Lambda function. 6. Choose Save.
Step 2: Register an event rule
Next, you create a CloudWatch Events event rule that captures task events coming from your Amazon ECS clusters. This rule captures all events coming from all clusters within the account where it is defined. The task messages themselves contain information about the event source, including the cluster on which it resides, that you can use to filter and sort events programmatically.
Note When you use the AWS Management Console to create an event rule, the console automatically adds the IAM permissions necessary to grant CloudWatch Events permission to call your Lambda

function. If you are creating an event rule using the AWS CLI, you need to grant this permission explicitly. For more information, see Events and Event Patterns in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.
To route events to your Lambda function
1. Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/. 2. On the navigation pane, choose Events, Rules, Create rule. 3. For Event Source, choose ECS as the event source. By default, the rule applies to all Amazon ECS
events for all of your Amazon ECS groups. Alternatively, you can select specific events or a specific Amazon ECS group. 4. For Targets, choose Add target, for Target type, choose Lambda function, and then select your Lambda function. 5. Choose Configure details. 6. For Rule definition, type a name and description for your rule and choose Create rule.
Step 3: Test your rule
Finally, you create a CloudWatch Events event rule that captures task events coming from your Amazon ECS clusters. This rule captures all events coming from all clusters within the account where it is defined. The task messages themselves contain information about the event source, including the cluster on which it resides, that you can use to filter and sort events programmatically.
To test your rule
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. Choose Clusters, default. 3. On the Cluster : default screen, choose Tasks, Run new Task. 4. For Task Definition, select the latest version of console-sample-app-static and choose Run Task. 5. Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/. 6. On the navigation pane, choose Logs and select the log group for your Lambda function (for
example, /aws/lambda/my-function). 7. Select a log stream to view the event data.
Tutorial: Sending Amazon Simple Notification Service alerts for task stopped events
In this tutorial, you configure an Amazon EventBridge event rule that only captures task events where the task has stopped running because one of its essential containers has terminated. The event sends only task events with a specific stoppedReason property to the designated Amazon SNS topic.
Prerequisite: Set up a test cluster
If you do not have a running cluster to capture events from, follow the steps in Creating a cluster using the classic console (p. 77) to create one. At the end of this tutorial, you run a task on this cluster to test that you have configured your Amazon SNS topic and EventBridge rule correctly.
Step 1: Create and subscribe to an Amazon SNS topic
For this tutorial, you configure an Amazon SNS topic to serve as an event target for your new event rule.

Step 3: Test your rule
Verify that the rule is working by running a task that exits shortly after it starts. If your event rule is configured correctly, you receive an email message within a few minutes with the event text. If you have an existing task definition that can satisfy the rule requirements, run a task using it. If you do not, the following steps will walk you through registering a Fargate task definition and running it that will.
To test the rule
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. Choose Task Definitions, Create new Task Definition. 3. For Select launch type compatibility, choose FARGATE, Next step. 4. Choose Configure via JSON, copy and paste the following task definition JSON into the field and
choose Save.

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using Amazon ECS Exec for debugging
Amazon ECS troubleshooting
You may need to troubleshoot issues with your load balancers, tasks, services, or container instances. This chapter helps you find diagnostic information from the Amazon ECS container agent, the Docker daemon on the container instance, and the service event log in the Amazon ECS console.
Topics · Using Amazon ECS Exec for debugging (p. 433) · Checking stopped tasks for errors (p. 442) · Stopped tasks error codes (p. 444) · CannotPullContainer task errors (p. 447) · Service event messages (p. 450) · Invalid CPU or memory value specified (p. 453) · Troubleshooting service load balancers (p. 454) · Troubleshooting service auto scaling (p. 455) · AWS Fargate throttling quotas (p. 455) · API failure reasons (p. 456)
Using Amazon ECS Exec for debugging
With Amazon ECS Exec, you can directly interact with containers without needing to first interact with the host container operating system, open inbound ports, or manage SSH keys. You can use ECS Exec to run commands in or get a shell to a container running on an Amazon EC2 instance or on AWS Fargate. This makes it easier to collect diagnostic information and quickly troubleshoot errors. For example, in a development context, you can use ECS Exec to easily interact with various process in your containers and troubleshoot your applications. And, in production scenarios, you can use it to gain break-glass access to your containers to debug issues.
You can run commands in a running Linux or Windows container using ECS Exec from the Amazon ECS API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or the AWS Copilot CLI. For details on using ECS Exec, as well as a video walkthrough, using the AWS Copilot CLI, see the Copilot Github documentation.
You can also use ECS Exec to maintain stricter access control policies and audit container access. By selectively turning on this feature, you can control who can run commands and on which tasks they can run those commands. With a log of each command and their output, you can use ECS Exec to audit which tasks were run and you can use CloudTrail to audit who accessed a container.
Architecture
ECS Exec makes use of AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Session Manager to establish a connection with the running container and uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to running commands in a running container. This is made possible by bind-mounting the necessary SSM agent binaries into the container. The Amazon ECS or AWS Fargate agent is responsible for starting the SSM core agent inside the container alongside your application code. For more information, see Systems Manager Session Manager.
You can audit which user accessed the container using AWS CloudTrail and log each command (and their output) to Amazon S3 or Amazon CloudWatch Logs. To encrypt data between the local client and
433

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Considerations for using ECS Exec
container with your own encryption key, you must provide the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.
Considerations for using ECS Exec
For this topic, you should be familiar with the following aspects involved with using ECS Exec:
· ECS Exec is supported for AWS Fargate, external instances (ECS Anywhere), Linux containers hosted on Amazon EC2 and the following Windows Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs (with the container agent version 1.56 or later): · Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server 2022 Full AMI · Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server 2022 Core AMI · Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server 2019 Full AMI · Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server 2019 Core AMI · Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server 20H2 Core AMI
· ECS Exec is not currently supported using the AWS Management Console. · ECS Exec is not currently supported for tasks launched using an Auto Scaling group capacity provider. · If you are using interface Amazon VPC endpoints with Amazon ECS, you must create the interface
Amazon VPC endpoints for Systems Manager Session Manager. For more information, see Create the Systems Manager Session Manager VPC endpoints when using the ECS Exec feature (p. 378). · You can't enable ECS Exec for existing tasks. It can only be enabled for new tasks. · When a user runs commands on a container using ECS Exec, these commands are run as the root user. The SSM agent and its child processes run as root even when you specify a user ID for the container. · The ECS Exec session has a default idle timeout time of 20 minutes. For more information, see see Specify an idle session timeout value in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. · The SSM agent requires that the container file system is able to be written to in order to create the required directories and files. Therefore, making the root file system read-only using the readonlyRootFilesystem task definition parameter, or any other method, isn't supported. · Users can run all of the commands that are available within the container context. The following actions might result in orphaned and zombie processes: terminating the main process of the container, terminating the command agent, and deleting dependencies. To cleanup zombie processes, we recommend adding the initProcessEnabled flag to your task definition. · While starting SSM sessions outside of the execute-command action is possible, this results in the sessions not being logged and being counted against the session limit. We recommend limiting this access by denying the ssm:start-session action using an IAM policy. For more information, see Limiting access to the Start Session action (p. 441). · ECS Exec will use some CPU and memory. You'll want to accommodate for that when specifying the CPU and memory resource allocations in your task definition. · You must be using AWS CLI version 1.22.3 or later or AWS CLI version 2.3.6 or later. For information about how to update the AWS CLI, see Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide Version 2. · You cannot use ECS Exec when you use run-task to launch a task on a cluster that uses managed scaling with asynchronous placement (launch a task with no instance). · You cannot run ECS Exec against Microsoft Nano Server containers. For more information about Nano Server containers, see Nano Server on the Docker web site.
Prerequisites for using ECS Exec
Before you start using ECS Exec, make sure you that you have completed these actions:
434

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Enabling and using ECS Exec
· Install and configure the AWS CLI. For more information, see AWS CLI. · Install Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI. For more information, see Install the Session Manager
plugin for the AWS CLI. · ECS Exec has version requirements depending on whether your tasks are hosted on Amazon EC2 or
AWS Fargate: · If you're using Amazon EC2, you must use an Amazon ECS optimized AMI that was released after
January 20th, 2021, with an agent version of 1.50.2 or greater. For more information, see Amazon ECS optimized AMIs. · If you're using AWS Fargate, you must use platform version 1.4.0 or higher (Linux) or 1.0.0 (Windows). For more information, see AWS Fargate platform versions.
Enabling and using ECS Exec
IAM permissions required for ECS Exec
The ECS Exec feature requires a task IAM role to grant containers the permissions needed for communication between the managed SSM agent (execute-command agent) and the SSM service. For more information, see Amazon ECS task IAM role. You should add the following permissions to a task IAM role and include the task IAM role in your task definition. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
Use the following policy for your task IAM role to add the required SSM permissions.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel", "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel", "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel", "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel" ], "Resource": "*" } ]
}
Optional task definition changes
If you set the task definition parameter initProcessEnabled to true, this starts the init process inside the container, which removes any zombie SSM agent child processes found. The following provides an example.
{ "taskRoleArn": "ecsTaskRole", "networkMode": "awsvpc", "requiresCompatibilities": [ "EC2", "FARGATE" ], "executionRoleArn": "ecsTaskExecutionRole", "memory": ".5 gb", "cpu": ".25 vcpu", "containerDefinitions": [
435

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Enabling and using ECS Exec
{ "name": "amazon-linux", "image": "amazonlinux:latest", "essential": true, "command": ["sleep","3600"], "linuxParameters": { "initProcessEnabled": true }
} ], "family": "ecs-exec-task" }
Enabling ECS Exec for your tasks and services
You can enable the ECS Exec feature for your services and standalone tasks by specifying the --enableexecute-command flag when using one of the following AWS CLI commands: create-service, update-service, start-task, or run-task.
For example, if you run the following command, the ECS Exec feature is enabled for a newly created service. For more information about creating services, see create-service.
aws ecs create-service \ --cluster cluster-name \ --task-definition task-definition-name \ --enable-execute-command \ --service-name service-name \ --desired-count 1
After you have enabled ECS Exec for a task, you can run the following command to confirm the task is ready to be used. If the lastStatus property of the ExecuteCommandAgent is listed as RUNNING and the enableExecuteCommand property is set to true, then your task is ready.
aws ecs describe-tasks \ --cluster cluster-name \ --tasks task-id
The following output snippet is an example of what you might see.
{ "tasks": [ { ... "containers": [ { ... "managedAgents": [ { "lastStartedAt": "2021-03-01T14:49:44.574000-06:00", "name": "ExecuteCommandAgent", "lastStatus": "RUNNING" } ] } ], ... "enableExecuteCommand": true, ... } ]
436

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Logging and Auditing using ECS Exec
}
Running commands using ECS Exec
After you have confirmed the ExecuteCommandAgent is running, you can open an interactive shell on your container using the following command. If your task contains multiple containers, you must specify the container name using the --container flag. Amazon ECS only supports initiating interactive sessions, so you must use the --interactive flag.
The following command will run an interactive /bin/sh command against a container named container-name for a task with an id of task-id.
aws ecs execute-command --cluster cluster-name \ --task task-id \ --container container-name \ --interactive \ --command "/bin/sh"
Logging and Auditing using ECS Exec
Enabling logging and auditing in your tasks and services
Amazon ECS provides a default configuration for logging commands run using ECS Exec by sending logs to CloudWatch Logs using the awslogs log driver that's configured in your task definition. If you want to provide a custom configuration, the AWS CLI supports a --configuration flag for both the create-cluster and update-cluster commands. It's also important to know that the container image requires script and cat to be installed in order to have command logs uploaded correctly to Amazon S3 or CloudWatch Logs. For more information about creating clusters, see create-cluster.
Note This configuration only handles the logging of the execute-command session. It doesn't affect logging of your application.
The following example creates a service and then logs the output to your CloudWatch Logs LogGroup named cloudwatch-log-group-name and your Amazon S3 bucket named s3-bucket-name.
You must use an AWS KMS customer managed key to encrypt the log group when you set the CloudWatchEncryptionEnabled option to true. For information about how to encrypt the log group, see Encrypt log data in CloudWatch Logs using AWS Key Management Service, in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
aws ecs create-cluster \ --cluster-name cluster-name \ --configuration executeCommandConfiguration="{ \ kmsKeyId=string, \ logging=OVERRIDE, \ logConfiguration={ \ cloudWatchLogGroupName=cloudwatch-log-group-name, \ cloudWatchEncryptionEnabled=true, \ s3BucketName=s3-bucket-name, \ s3EncryptionEnabled=true, \ s3KeyPrefix=demo \ } \ }"
The logging property determines the behavior of the logging capability of ECS Exec:
· NONE: logging is disabled
437

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Logging and Auditing using ECS Exec
· DEFAULT: logs are sent to the configured awslogs driver (If the driver isn't configured, then no log is saved.)
· OVERRIDE: logs are sent to the provided Amazon CloudWatch Logs LogGroup, Amazon S3 bucket, or both
IAM permissions required for Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3 Logging
To enable logging, the Amazon ECS task role that's referenced in your task definition needs to have additional permissions. These additional permissions can be added as an inline policy to the task role. They are different depending on if you direct your logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3.
Amazon CloudWatch Logs
The following example inline policy adds the required Amazon CloudWatch Logs permissions.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "logs:DescribeLogGroups" ], "Resource": "*" }, { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:DescribeLogStreams", "logs:PutLogEvents" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:/aws/ecs/cloudwatch-
log-group-name:*" }
] }
Amazon S3
The following example inline policy adds the required Amazon S3 permissions.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetBucketLocation" ], "Resource": "*" }, { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket-name" },
438

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using IAM policies to limit access to ECS Exec
{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:PutObject" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::s3-bucket-name/*"
} ] }
IAM permissions required for encryption using your own AWS KMS key (KMS key)
By default, the data transferred between your local client and the container uses TLS 1.2 encryption that AWS provides. To further encrypt data using your own KMS key, you must create a KMS key and add the kms:Decrypt permission to your task IAM role. This permission is used by your container to decrypt the data. For more information about creating a KMS key, see Creating keys.
You would add the following inling policy to your task IAM role which requires the AWS KMS permissions. For more information, see IAM permissions required for ECS Exec (p. 435).
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "kms:Decrypt" ], "Resource": "kms-key-arn" } ]
}
For the data to be encrypted using your own KMS key, the user or group using the execute-command action must be granted the kms:GenerateDataKey permission.
The following example policy for your user or group contains the required permission to use your own KMS key. You must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "kms:GenerateDataKey" ], "Resource": "kms-key-arn" } ]
}
Using IAM policies to limit access to ECS Exec
You can limit user access to the execute-command API action by using one or more of the following IAM policy condition keys:
439

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using IAM policies to limit access to ECS Exec
· aws:ResourceTag/clusterTagKey · ecs:ResourceTag/clusterTagKey · aws:ResourceTag/taskTagKey · ecs:ResourceTag/taskTagKey · ecs:container-name · ecs:cluster · ecs:task · ecs:enable-execute-command
With the following example IAM policy, users can run commands in containers that are running within tasks with a tag that has an environment key and development value and in a cluster that's named cluster-name.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ecs:ExecuteCommand", "ecs:DescribeTasks" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws-account-id:task/cluster-name/*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "ecs:ResourceTag/environment": "development" } } } ]
}
With the following IAM policy example, users can't use the execute-command API when the container name is production-app.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Deny", "Action": [ "ecs:ExecuteCommand" ], "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "ecs:container-name": "production-app" } } } ]
}
With the following IAM policy, users can only launch tasks when ECS Exec is disabled.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [
440

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Using IAM policies to limit access to ECS Exec
{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "ecs:RunTask", "ecs:StartTask", "ecs:CreateService", "ecs:UpdateService" ], "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "ecs:enable-execute-command": "false" } }
} ] }
Note Because the execute-command API action contains only task and cluster resources in a request, only cluster and task tags are evaluated.
For more information about IAM policy condition keys, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Elastic Container Service in the Service Authorization Reference.
Limiting access to the Start Session action
While starting SSM sessions on your container outside of ECS Exec is possible, this could potentially result in the sessions not being logged. Sessions started outside of ECS Exec also count against the session quota. We recommend limiting this access by denying the ssm:start-session action directly for your Amazon ECS tasks using an IAM policy. You can deny access to all Amazon ECS tasks or to specific tasks based on the tags used.
The following is an example IAM policy that denies access to the ssm:start-session action for tasks in all Regions with a specified cluster name. You can optionally include a wildcard with the clustername.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Deny", "Action": "ssm:StartSession", "Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:*:111122223333:task/cluster-name/*" } ]
}
The following is an example IAM policy that denies access to the ssm:start-session action on resources in all Regions tagged with tag key Task-Tag-Key and tag value Exec-Task.
{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Deny", "Action": "ssm:StartSession", "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "aws:ResourceTag/Task-Tag-Key": "Exec-Task"

Troubleshooting issues with ECS Exec
The following are troubleshooting notes to help diagnose why you may be getting an error when using ECS Exec.
Verify using the Amazon ECS Exec Checker
The Amazon ECS Exec Checker script provides a way to verify and validate that your Amazon ECS cluster and task have met the prerequisites for using the ECS Exec feature. The Exec Checker script verifies both your AWS CLI environment and cluster and tasks are ready for ECS Exec, by calling various APIs on your behalf. The tool requires the latest version of the AWS CLI and that the jq is available. For more information, see Amazon ECS Exec Checker on GitHub.
Error when calling execute-command
If a The execute command failed error occurs, the following are possible causes.
· The task does not have the required permissions. Verify that the task definition used to launch your task has a task IAM role defined and that the role has the required permissions. For more information, see IAM permissions required for ECS Exec (p. 435).
· The SSM agent is not installed or is not running · There is an interface Amazon VPC endpoint for Amazon ECS, but there is not one for for Systems
Manager Session Manager
Checking stopped tasks for errors
If you have trouble starting a task, your task might be stopping because of an error. For example, you run the task and the task displays a PENDING status and then disappears. You can view stopped task errors like this in the Amazon ECS console by viewing the stopped task and inspecting it for error messages.
Important Amazon ECS also sends task state change events to EventBridge, which you can view if your stopped task has expired from view in the Amazon ECS console. For more information, see Task state change events (p. 299). For information about how to investigate a task that was stopped more than 1 hour, see ECS Stopped Tasks in CloudWatch Logs on the GitHub website.

TaskFailedToStart

TaskFailedToStart

This error occurs when an ENI attachment is requested. Amazon EC2 asynchronously handles the provisioning of the ENI. The provisioning process takes time. Amazon ECS has a timeout in case there are long wait times or unreported failures. There are times when the ENI is provisioned, but the report comes to Amazon ECS after the failure timeout. In this case, Amazon ECS sees the reported task failure with an in-use ENI.

CannotPullContainer task errors
The following errors indicate that, when creating a task, the container image specified can't be retrieved.

447

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate CannotPullContainer task errors
Note The 1.4 Fargate platform version truncates long error messages.
Connection timed out
When a Fargate task is launched, its elastic network interface requires a route to the internet to pull container images. If you receive an error similar to the following when launching a task, it's because a route to the internet doesn't exist:
CannotPullContainerError: API error (500): Get https://111122223333.dkr.ecr.useast-1.amazonaws.com/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection"
To resolve this issue, you can: · For tasks in public subnets, specify ENABLED for Auto-assign public IP when launching the task.
For more information, see Run a standalone task (p. 202). · For tasks in private subnets, specify DISABLED for Auto-assign public IP when launching the task,
and configure a NAT gateway in your VPC to route requests to the internet. For more information, see NAT Gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide. Context canceled
The common cause for this error is because the VPC your task is using doesn't have a route to pull the container image from Amazon ECR. Image not found
When you specify an Amazon ECR image in your container definition, you must use the full URI of your ECR repository along with the image name in that repository. If the repository or image can't be found, you receive the following error:
CannotPullContainerError: API error (404): repository 111122223333.dkr.ecr.useast-1.amazonaws.com/<repo>/<image> not found
To resolve this issue, verify the repository URI and the image name. Also make sure that you have set up the proper access using the task execution IAM role. For more information about the task execution role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role (p. 354). Insufficient disk space
If the root volume of your container instance has insufficient disk space when pulling the container image, you see an error similar to the following:
CannotPullContainerError: write /var/lib/docker/tmp/GetImageBlob111111111: no space left on device
To resolve this issue, free up disk space.
If you are using the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI, you can use the following command to retrieve the 20 largest files on your filesystem:
du -Sh / | sort -rh | head -20
Example output:
5.7G /var/lib/docker/ containers/50501b5f4cbf90b406e0ca60bf4e6d4ec8f773a6c1d2b451ed8e0195418ad0d2 1.2G /var/log/ecs

In some cases, similar to the preceding example, the root volume might be filled out by a running
container. If the container is using the default json-file log driver without a max-size limit, it may be that the log file is responsible for most of that space used. You can use the docker ps command to verify which container is using the space by mapping the directory name from the
output above to the container ID. For example:

CONTAINER ID STATUS
50501b5f4cbf Up 4 days

IMAGE PORTS
amazon/amazon-ecs-agent:latest

COMMAND NAMES
"/agent" ecs-agent

CREATED 4 days ago

By default, when using the json-file log driver, Docker captures the standard output (and standard error) of all of your containers and writes them in files using the JSON format. You can set the max-size as a log driver option, which prevents the log file from taking up too much space. For more information, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.
The following is a container definition snippet showing how to use this option:

{ "log-driver": "json-file", "log-opts": { "max-size": "256m" }
}

An alternative if your container logs are taking up too much disk space is to use the awslogs log driver. The awslogs log driver sends the logs to CloudWatch, which frees up the disk space that would otherwise be used for your container logs on the container instance. For more information, see Using the awslogs log driver (p. 138).
Docker Hub rate limiting
If you receive one of the following errors, you're likely hitting the Docker Hub rate limits:

ERROR: toomanyrequests: Too Many Requests.

You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits.
For more information about the Docker Hub rate limits, see Understanding Docker Hub rate limiting.
If you have increased the Docker Hub rate limit and you need to authenticate your Docker pulls for your container instances, see Private registry authentication for container instances in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Fail to copy image
If you receive an error similar to the following when launching a task, it's because there is no access to the image:
CannotPullContainerError: ref pull has been retried 1 time(s): failed to copy: httpReaderSeeker: failed open: unexpected status code

For additional information about STOPPED errors, see Stopped tasks error codes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service User Guide for AWS Fargate.
Service event messages
When troubleshooting a problem with a service, the first place you should check for diagnostic information is the service event log. You can view service events using the DescribeServices API, the AWS CLI, or by using the AWS Management Console.
When viewing service event messages using the Amazon ECS API, only the events from the service scheduler are returned. These include the most recent task placement and instance health events. However, the Amazon ECS console displays service events from the following sources.
· Task placement and instance health events from the Amazon ECS service scheduler. These events will have a prefix of service (service-name). To ensure that this event view is helpful, we only show the 100 most recent events and duplicate event messages are omitted until either the cause is resolved or six hours passes. If the cause is not resolved within six hours, you will receive another service event message for that cause.
· Service Auto Scaling events. These events will have a prefix of Message. The 10 most recent scaling events are shown. These events only occur when a service is configured with an Application Auto Scaling scaling policy.
Use the following steps to view your current service event messages.
New console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. 3. On the Clusters page, choose the cluster. 4. On the Cluster : name page, choose the Services tab. 5. Choose the service to inspect. 6. In the Notifications section, view the messages.
Classic console
1. Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. 2. On the Clusters page, select the cluster where your stopped task resides. 3. On the Cluster : clustername page, choose Tasks. 4. In the Desired task status table header, choose Stopped, and then select the stopped task to
inspect. The most recent stopped tasks are listed first. 5. In the Details section, inspect the Stopped reason field to see the reason that the task was
stopped.
450

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Service event messages
6. If you have a container that has stopped, expand the container and inspect the Status reason row to see what caused the task state to change.
In the previous example, the container image name can't be found. This can happen if you misspell the image name. If this inspection doesn't provide enough information, see Stopped tasks error codes (p. 444) for more information. AWS CLI Use the describe-services command to view the service event messages for a specified service. The following AWS CLI example describes the service-name service in the default cluster, which will provide the latest service event messages.

Service event messages
The following are examples of service event messages you may see in the Amazon ECS console.
service (service-name) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully.
This service contains tasks that have failed to start after consecutive attempts. At this point, the service scheduler begins to incrementally increase the time between retries. You should troubleshoot why your tasks are failing to launch. For more information, see Service throttle logic (p. 274).
After the service is updated, for example with an updated task definition, the service scheduler resumes normal behavior.
service (service-name) operations are being throttled. Will try again later.
This service is unable to launch more tasks due to API throttling limits. Once the service scheduler is able to launch more tasks, it will resume.
To request an API rate limit quota increase, open the AWS Support Center page, sign in if necessary, and choose Create case. Choose Service limit increase. Complete and submit the form.
service (service-name) was unable to stop or start tasks during a deployment because of the service deployment configuration. Update the minimumHealthyPercent or maximumPercent value and try again.
This service is unable to stop or start tasks during a service deployment due to the deployment configuration. The deployment configuration consists of the minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent values which are defined when the service is created, but can also be updated on an existing service.
The minimumHealthyPercent represents the lower limit on the number of tasks that should be running for a service during a deployment or when a container instance is draining, as a percent of the desired number of tasks for the service. This value is rounded up. For example if the minimum healthy percent is 50 and the desired task count is four, then the scheduler can stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Likewise, if the minimum healthy percent is 75% and the desired task count is two, then the scheduler can't stop any tasks due to the resulting value also being two.
The maximumPercent represents the upper limit on the number of tasks that should be running for a service during a deployment or when a container instance is draining, as a percent of the desired number of tasks for a service. This value is rounded down. For example if the maximum percent is 200 and the desired task count is four then the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping four existing tasks. Likewise, if the maximum percent is 125 and the desired task count is three, the scheduler can't start any tasks due to the resulting value also being three.
When setting a minimum healthy percent or a maximum percent, you should ensure that the scheduler can stop or start at least one task when a deployment is triggered.
service (service-name) was unable to place a task. Reason: You've reached the limit on the number of tasks you can run concurrently
You can request a quota increase for the resource that caused the error. For more information, see the section called "Service quotas" (p. 281). To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide.

Invalid CPU or memory value specified
When registering a task definition using the Amazon ECS API or AWS CLI, if you specify an invalid cpu or memory value, the following error is returned.
An error occurred (ClientException) when calling the RegisterTaskDefinition operation: Invalid 'cpu' setting for task. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.
Note When using Terraform, the following error may be returned.
Error: ClientException: No Fargate configuration exists for given values.
To resolve this issue, you must specify a supported value for the task CPU and memory in your task definition. The cpu value can be expressed in CPU units or vCPUs in a task definition but is converted to an integer indicating the CPU units when the task definition is registered. The memory value can be expressed in MiB or GB in a task definition but is converted to an integer indicating the MiB when the task definition is registered.
For task definitions that only specify EC2 for the requiresCompatibilities parameter, the supported CPU values are between 128 CPU units (0.125 vCPUs) and 10240 CPU units (10 vCPUs). The memory value must be an integer and the limit is dependent upon the amount of available memory on the underlying Amazon EC2 instance you use.
For task definitions that specify FARGATE for the requiresCompatibilities parameter (even if EC2 is also specified), you must use one of the values in the following table, which determines your range of supported values for the CPU and memory parameter.
Supported task CPU and memory values for tasks that are hosted on Fargate are as follows.

Troubleshooting service load balancers
Amazon ECS services can register tasks with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer. Load balancer configuration errors are common causes for stopped tasks. If your stopped tasks were started by services that use a load balancer, consider the following possible causes.
Important Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of a service that is configured to use a Classic Load Balancer. The Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores tasks in an UNHEALTHY state that are behind a Classic Load Balancer.
Container instance security group
If your container is mapped to port 80 on your container instance, your container instance security group must allow inbound traffic on port 80 for the load balancer health checks to pass. Elastic Load Balancing load balancer not configured for all Availability Zones
Your load balancer should be configured to use all of the Availability Zones in a Region, or at least all of the Availability Zones where your container instances reside. If a service uses a load balancer and starts a task on a container instance that resides in an Availability Zone that the load balancer isn't configured to use, the task never passes the health check and it's killed. Elastic Load Balancing load balancer health check misconfigured
The load balancer health check parameters can be overly restrictive or point to resources that don't exist. If a container instance is determined to be unhealthy, it is removed from the load balancer. Be sure to verify that the following parameters are configured correctly for your service load balancer. Ping Port
The Ping Port value for a load balancer health check is the port on the container instances that the load balancer checks to determine if it is healthy. If this port is misconfigured, the load balancer likely deregisters your container instance from itself. This port should be configured to use the hostPort value for the container in your service's task definition that you're using with the health check. Ping Path
This value is often set to index.html, but if your service doesn't respond to that request, then the health check fails. If your container doesn't have an index.html file, you can set this to / to target the base URL for the container instance. Response Timeout
This is the amount of time that your container has to return a response to the health check ping. If this value is lower than the amount of time required for a response, the health check fails.
454

Amazon ECS User Guide for AWS Fargate Troubleshooting service auto scaling

Health Check Interval
This is the amount of time between health check pings. The shorter your health check intervals are, the faster your container instance can reach the Unhealthy Threshold. Unhealthy Threshold
This is the number of times your health check can fail before your container instance is considered unhealthy. If you have an unhealthy threshold of 2, and a health check interval of 30 seconds, then your task has 60 seconds to respond to the health check ping before it is assumed unhealthy. You can raise the unhealthy threshold or the health check interval to give your tasks more time to respond. Unable to update the service servicename: Load balancer container name or port changed in task definition
If your service uses a load balancer, the load balancer configuration defined for your service when it was created cannot be changed. If you update the task definition for the service, the container name and container port that were specified when the service was created must remain in the task definition.
To change the load balancer name, the container name, or the container port associated with a service load balancer configuration, you must create a new service. You've reached the limit on the number of tasks you can run concurrently.
For a new account, your quotas might be lower that the service quotas. The service quota for your account can be viewed in the Service Quotas console. To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide.

Troubleshooting service auto scaling
Application Auto Scaling disables scale-in processes while Amazon ECS deployments are in progress and they resume once the deployment has completed. However, scale-out processes continue to occur, unless suspended, during a deployment. For more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling for Application Auto Scaling.

AWS Fargate throttling quotas
AWS Fargate limits Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods launch rates to quotas (formerly referred to as limits) using a token bucket algorithm for each AWS account on a per-Region basis. With this algorithm, your account has a bucket that holds a specific number of tokens. The number of tokens in the bucket represents your rate quota at any given second. Each customer account has a tasks and pods token bucket that depletes based on the number of tasks and pods launched by the customer account. This token bucket has a bucket maximum that allows you to periodically make a higher number of requests, and a refill rate that allows you to sustain a steady rate of requests for as long as needed.
For example, the tasks and pods token bucket size for a Fargate customer account is 100 tokens, and the refill rate is 20 tokens per second. Therefore, you can immediately launch up to 100 Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods per customer account, with a sustained launch rate of 20 Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods per second.

1Accounts launching only Amazon EKS pods have a burst rate of 20 with a sustained pod launch rate of 20 pod launches per second when using the platform versions called out in the Amazon EKS platform versions.
Throttling the RunTask API
In addition, Fargate limits the request rate when launching tasks using the Amazon ECS RunTask API using a separate quota. Fargate limits Amazon ECS RunTask API requests for each AWS account on a per-Region basis. Each request that you make removes one token from the bucket. We do this to help the performance of the service, and to ensure fair usage for all Fargate customers. API calls are subject to the request quotas whether they originate from the Amazon Elastic Container Service console, a command line tool, or a third-party application. The rate quota for calls to the Amazon ECS RunTask API is 20 calls per second (burst and sustained). Each call to this API can, however, launch up to 10 tasks. This means you can launch 100 tasks in one second by making 10 calls to this API, requesting 10 tasks to be launched in each call. Similarly, you could also make 20 calls to this API, requesting 5 tasks to be launched in each call. For more information on API throttling for Amazon ECS RunTask API , see API request throttling in the Amazon ECS API Reference.
In practice, task and pod launch rates are also dependent on other considerations such as container images to be downloaded and unpacked, health checks and other integrations enabled, such as registering tasks or pods into a load balancer. Customers will see variations in task and pod launch rates compared with the quotas represented above based on the features that customers enable.
Adjusting rate quotas
You can request an increase for Fargate rate throttling quotas for your AWS account. To request a quota adjustment, contact the AWS Support Center.

API failure reasons
When an API action that you have triggered through the Amazon ECS API, console, or the AWS CLI exits with a failures error message, the following may assist in troubleshooting the cause. The failure will return a reason and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource associated with the failure.
Many resources are Region-specific, so when using the console ensure that you set the correct Region for your resources. When using the AWS CLI, make sure that your AWS CLI commands are being sent to the correct Region with the --region region parameter.
For more information about the structure of the Failure data type, see Failure in the Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference.
The following are examples of failure messages you might receive when running API commands.

· The network traffic behavior to and from tasks has been updated. Starting with platform version 1.4.0, all Fargate tasks receive a single elastic network interface, referred to as the task ENI. All network traffic flows through that ENI within your VPC and will be visible to you through your VPC flow logs. For more information, see Fargate task networking (p. 136).
· Task ENIs add support for jumbo frames. Network interfaces are configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU), which is the size of the largest payload that fits within a single frame. The larger the MTU, the larger the application payload that can fit within a single frame, which reduces per-frame overhead and increases efficiency. Supporting jumbo frames reduces overhead when the network path between your task and the destination supports jumbo frames, such as all traffic that remains within your VPC.
· CloudWatch Container Insights will include network performance metrics for Fargate tasks. For more information, see Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights (p. 308).
· Added support for the task metadata endpoint v4, which provides additional information for your Fargate tasks, including network stats for the task and which Availability Zone the task is running in. For more information, see Task metadata endpoint version 4 (p. 380).
· Added support for the SYS_PTRACE Linux parameter in container definitions. For more information, see Linux parameters (p. 115).
· The Fargate container agent replaces the use of the Amazon ECS container agent for all Fargate tasks. This change should not affect how your tasks run.
· The container runtime is now using Containerd instead of Docker. This change should not affect how your tasks run. You may notice that some error messages that originate with the container runtime are more general and do not mention Docker.

Amazon ECS service

Amazon ECS introduced the concept of service scheduler 12 June

scheduler strategies added strategies.

2018

There are two service scheduler strategies available:

· REPLICA--The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Replica (p. 213).
· DAEMON--The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, there is no need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Daemon in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Note Fargate tasks do not support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.
