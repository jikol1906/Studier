An IaaS provider is responsible for the entire infrastructure, but users have total control over it. In turn, users are responsible for installingSapnrdead the maintaining apps and operating systems, as well as for security, runtime, middleware and data.

IaaS Key Features

Highly scalable resources Enterprise-grade infrastructure Cost depends on consumption Multitenant architecture, i.e. a single piece of hardware serves many users The client gets complete control over the infrastructure
IaaS Advantages

The most flexible and dynamic model Cost-effective due to pay-as-you-go pricing Easy to use due to the automate d deployment of hardware Management tasks are virtualized, so employees have more free time for other tasks
IaaS Disadvantages

Data security issues due to multitenant architecture Vendor outages make customers unable to access their data for a while The need for team training to learn how to manage new infrastructure
When to Use IaaS

IaaS can be especially advantageous in some situations:
If you are a small company or a startup that has no budget for creating your own infrastructure If you are a rapidly growing company and your demands are unstable and changeable If you are a large company that wants to have effective control over infrastructure but pay only for the resources you actually use
Examples of IaaS
The best-known IaaS solution s vendors are Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Amazon Web Services ( AWS ), Cisco Metapod, DigitalOcean, Linode and Rackspace.

PaaS: Platform as a Service

PaaS in cloud computing is a framework for software creation delivered over the internet. This is the offering of a platform with built-in software components and tools, using which developers can create, customize, test and launch applications. PaaS vendors manage servers, operating system updates, security patches and backups. Clients focus on app development and data without worrying about infrastructure, middleware and OS maintenance.
The main difference between IaaS and PaaS lies in the degree of control given to users.
PaaS Key Features

Allows for developing, testing and hosting apps in the same environment

SaaS software resides on a remote cloud network and can be accessed through the web or APIs. Using such apps, customers can collaborate on projects, as well as store and analyze data.
SaaS is the most common category of cloud computing. The SaaS provider manages everything from hardware stability to app functioning. Clients are not responsible for anything in this model; they only use programs to complete their tasks. In this case, the client software experience is fully dependent on the provider.
SaaS Key Features
The subscription model of utilizing No need to download, install or upgrade software Resources can be scaled depending on requirements Apps are accessible from any connected device The provider is responsible for everything
SaaS Advantages
No hardware costs No initial setup costs Automated upgrades Cross-device compatibility Accessible from any location Pay-as-you-go model Scalability Easy customization
SaaS Disadvantages

The Difference Between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
The table below provides a clear comparison of IaaS vs. PaaS vs. SaaS. Platform as a Service vs. Infrastructure as a Service gives less control to the user, but Platform as a Service vs. Software as a Service gives more control to the user. If you were to compare IaaS vs. SaaS, IaaS is the place you can move to and work from using available resources, while SaaS is a ready-made product you can utilize immediately without additional efforts.

Spread the The usage-based payment model for SaaS products is something that lots of different software companies are using lately, and when they switch to that type of payment model, their customer retention and sales numbers typically go up. Another advantage of using SaaS over traditional software.

In my opinion, I think the next area that's poised for lots of growth will be the PaaS market. Lots of companies want to move to a cloud-based development environment, and PaaS makes that a very easy/straightforward process.

The IaaS section details that data security is an integral problem with this delivery model. Is this something that can be mitigated somehow? Cloud security is an important topic, especially with digital transformation being a high priority in the industry at the moment.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service is one delivery model that I think will become more popular soon. SaaS is probably the most popular, but decentralized IaaS is an area poised for a lot of growth (in my opinion).

I don't think many people outside of the IT industry realize how much cloud computing runs nearly everything they use. I think the industry will only continue growing, to the point where nearly all products are cloud-based in some form or another.
