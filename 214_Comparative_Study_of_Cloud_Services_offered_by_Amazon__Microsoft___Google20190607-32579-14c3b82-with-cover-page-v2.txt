ABSTRACT With the accelerated development in processing and storage technologies and the boom of the Internet, IT Hardware have become inexpensive, more potent and highly available than ever before. This has triggered the commencement of a new computing model called cloud computing, in which IT-Resources are catered as general utilities that can be hired and released by users through the Internet in an on-demand fashion. According to Gartner Survey Report, The marketplace for public-cloud is predicted to reach from `$260 billion' in 2017 to around `$411 billion in 2020'. As more and more IT systems are externalized, it is getting more imminent for us to choose the right cloud service provider for long term success. However, the challenge is to choose the best cloud service provider from the vast number of options like AWS, Azure and GCP to the smaller CSP's. As per Market share the Top 3 Global leaders are AWS, Azure and GCP1. In this paper, we will try to make analysis of between the three market leaders in cloud services namely Amazon, Microsoft & Google. We will also compare and contrast what AWS, Azure, and GCP offer in terms of storage, compute, management tools etc.
KEYWORDS: Cloud service Provider (CSP), Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

INTRODUCTION

Before an organization finds the best Cloud Service Provider,

it should freeze its exact requirement. Sometimes

organizations need Software as a Service and end up hiring

Infrastructure as a Service. Hence an Organization should

know its exact requirements with context to IaaS, SaaS &

PaaS.

IaaS - In an IaaS model2, a CSP hosts the hardware components originally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. The IaaS provider also provides a range of services to convoy those infrastructure components. These can include detailedbilling, monitoring, log-access, security, load-balancing and clustering, as well as storage-resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery. IaaS customers access resources and services through a (WAN), such as the internet, and can use the cloud provider's services to install the remaining elements of an application stack.

SaaS - SaaS eliminates the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own servers or in their own data-centers3. This eliminates the expense of hardware procurement, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software-licensing, installation and support. Rather than procuring software to install, or additional hardware to

support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, they pay for this service on a monthly/hourly basis using a `pay-as-you-go' model. Transitioning costs to a periodic operating expense allows many big-business to exercise better and more foreseeable budgeting. Users can also terminate SaaS offerings at any time to stop those periodic costs.
PaaS - PaaS does not normally replace a business's entire ITInfra. Instead, a business trusts on PaaS providers for keyservices, such as application hosting or Java development. A PaaS provider forms and supplies a strong and optimized environment on which users can install applications and data-sets. Users can emphasis on making and running applications rather than constructing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services. Many PaaS products are geared toward software-development. These platforms offer compute and storage infra, as well as text editing, version-management, compiling and testing services that help software-engineers create new software more quickly and efficiently. A PaaS product can also enable development teams to join forces and work together, regardless of their physical-work-location.
Finding a cloud service provider (CSP) has become an intricate judgement. Nowadays it's not a question of which

option we should work with, but rather, how to achieve the right performance and dispense risk across multiple vendors--while optimizing the cost.
In view of the above discussions, it can be envisaged that every organization should finalize CSP based on its Capabilities in IaaS, SaaS & PaaS. If any Organization is looking for Iaas then it should look for those CSP's which are having an edge on Iaas.

Major Cloud Computing Service-Providers

There are several cloud-computing service-providers

available in industry. Few leading companies are listed

below as per Gartner's Magic Quadrant4:-

1. Amazon Web Services - Launched in 2006

2. Microsoft Azure - Launched in 2010

3. Google Cloud Platform - Launched in 2008

4. Alibaba Cloud - Launched in 2009

5. Oracle Cloud- Launched in 2012

6. IBM Cloud- Launched in 2011

Market Share and Usages

Amazon Web Services holds 33 percent of the cloud infrastructure market, according to data published by Synergy Research

Group. Microsoft's stake of the market hopped to 13 percent from 10 percent a year before. Google improved to six percent

from five percent. AWS market-share chopped by a percentage point5

XII. Key Benefits of AWS, AZURE & GCP

S. NO

AWS

Dominates cloud domain with

1 features such as configuration,

monitoring, security, auto-scaling etc.

2 Better Offering

3 More Experience, enterprise friendly services
4 More open source tools integration 5 Global Reach

AZURE More reliable when comes to integrating with Microsoft tools Better Development and testing tools Also provide Hybrid cloud

GCP
Expertise in DevOps
Flexible discounts & contracts Specifically designed for cloud-based businesses

XIII. Drawbacks of AWS, AZURE & GCP

S. NO

AWS

AZURE

1 The price structure Azure is lacking in the area of DevOps is a bit intricate

AWS doesn't have a Azure's support for other operating-

2 specific "hybrid

systems is very limited, only

cloud" solution

supporting a limited varieties of Linux.

Table - 10

GCP GCP does not offer as many services as AWS or Azure. GCP is the newest out of the three providers, that means it's the least mature in terms of variety of offerings

XIV. Conclusion Although AWS leads in public cloud market share, but it would be incorrect to claim it provides the top solutions. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform sure have their added advantages if you're looking for easy business solutions or foolproof security. The idea is - there's no universal best when it comes to Cloud Service Provider, it all derives down to what best suits your requirements.

XV. Recommendations In order to distribute Risk, the Organizations should go for Multi-Vendor CSPs. The SaaS should be delegated to the CSP having better SaaS features, similarly the PaaS should be delegated to the CSP having better PaaS features and The IaaS should be delegated to the CSP having better IaaS features. The Major role in this aspect will be of the Managed Service Provider (MSP) who will ensure to provide multiple CSPs.
