Google Cloud Pricing vs AWS: A Fair Comparison?

March 20, 2021 
Topics: Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Data Migration, Google Cloud, Elementary
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the smallest of the big three cloud players but is quickly gaining popularity. When planning a Google Cloud migration, or considering a multi-cloud strategy, it is important to understand each cloud's service and pricing model, and how to compare pricing correctly. Because Google Cloud pricing is structured differently from Amazon in many cases, a direct comparison can be misleading.

In this cloud pricing comparison, we'll explain GCP vs. AWS pricing, where it makes sense to directly compare them and where it doesn't, and show pricing for common services side by side.

AWS vs. Google Cloud: Market Position
Gartner's 2020 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure places Amazon Web Services as the clear leader, both in execution and completeness of vision. Google Cloud, also in the leaders quadrant, is in third place behind Microsoft Azure (see our article on Azure vs Google Cloud).

Google Cloud vs AWS Pricing: Compute Instances
Let's have a look at the AWS vs. Google Cloud pricing for machine instances and object storage. Please check for the latest prices on the Google Cloud and AWS official pricing pages.
Also, for reference, check out our article about Azure vs Google Cloud.
On-Demand Google Cloud VMs vs. Amazon EC2 Instances
Below we provide a few examples of pricing for common instance sizes. AWS has a price advantage for general purpose and memory optimized instances,

while Google Cloud is cheaper for compute optimized, but take into account

that Google instances provide almost half the quantity of RAM.

Reserved Google Cloud VMs vs. Reserved Amazon EC2 Instances

Of AWS's four reserved instance options, only one is also offered by Google Cloud: per-month payments.
When directly comparing this option, Google Cloud offers very similar discounted pricing across most instance types. Again, the price should be offset by the fact that AWS instances offer more memory.
Another point to consider is that Google Cloud allows you to convert instance types during the commitment period, whereas AWS only offers this in a special

AWS Upfront Payment Options
AWS offers bigger discounts for upfront payments, which can make it more attractive than Google Cloud if you are prepared to pay some of all of the instance cost upfront.

See the table below to understand the additional discounts you can get on AWS for prepayment. The discounts are for General Purpose instances.

Google Cloud vs. AWS Pricing: Storage
Let's See how Google Cloud and AWS compare on two major cloud storage categories--elastic object storage, and block storage attached to compute instances.

Object Storage Pricing
There are two important differences between Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3:
Google Cloud charges for network egress and per operation performed on objects in storage, so you need to model your data access. Google Cloud offers instant access to all infrequent storage tiers, while Amazon's archive storage option has configurable access times that range from minutes to hours.
See our article on AWS storage tiers to gain a better understanding of Amazon's cold storage options.
Here is a flat comparison of storage prices per GB across the Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage:

Storage Parameters Google Cloud Price AWS Price Per GB Per GB

Frequent Access / First 50 TB

See Google's definition for Class A operations (heavy operations like INSERT) and Class B operations (light operation like GET).

Block Storage Pricing
Google Cloud and AWS both offer block storage--Google Cloud calls it persistent disks, and in AWS it is the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service.

There are two key differences to understand in Google Cloud vs. AWS block storage pricing:

Google Cloud Pricing vs AWS: A Fair Comparison?

Google provides high availability for persistent disks within an entire region

(across availability zones) or across multiple regions, whereas AWS only

provides redundancy inside the same availability zone.

AWS charges extra for "provisioned IOPS", a type of credit bank that allows EBS instances to burst above the regular throughput rates. Google does not have an IOPS limit and does not charge for extra IOPS.
